For someone like me, speed of learning and iteration matters. It needs to be high. As I gave myself some time in December to live as I want this year, mentally, I have realised a few things. I will start by sharing what I did. I limited my focus. I was spending time on Sanskrit and health. But my main focus was building something and/or finding someone to build with. I talked to 3 people. One of them was the founder of Dukan. He had an early exit. I have been looking for someone like him (more experienced in running the business, having experience in raising funds &amp; getting distribution). But when I started talking, unless for a few very specific domains, it is hard for me to commit to an existing idea. It needs to be a combination of excellent people + really impacting, deeptech, or personal problem for me to commit fully. And commit without having many expectations. </p><p>Hence, before jumping full-time without having anything and figuring it out, I want to figure something out or have a close idea of whatever that is, and then jump full-time. I am gonna make it simple and make it a focus. </p><p>I think I am ready to write my 2026 goals. See you there 👋</p><p> </p><p><strong>22nd of December</strong></p><p>I have half-built an AI cricket coach. I have a working pipeline, need to producctionize it. I built a useless macOS app to light up faces in calls, yes, it is a ring light. I have done meaningful work at LD. Have been instrumental in shared dataviz. Maybe there is a space in the AI config I can explore for a few months. </p><p>I have taken a long break in December. 22nd to 1st of Jan. Actual off started on 21st of December (Saturday). This has made me realize I can maybe still have a job and iteration on a few ideas inside. Have jobs as options and pick the most fun option; the other dimension being finances. </p><p> </p><p><strong>21st of November</strong></p><blockquote><p>There are plenty of options, among everything I choose you. </p></blockquote><p>There were options, and there will be. If anything, 2026 is the year I want to try my luck at building something new. There are probably two big priorities in life. Probably only one when I look at things from purely my own lens. I want to build something great. Something useful, something that creates value. I was saying the same things last year. Didn't do. Got settled into a job, to be honest. I have been doing great at my job. But probably not the best work of my life. </p><p>To have the best chances, I need to widen my net. I need to be doing many things until I hit something. I need to find people, circles who are on the journey. I need to figure, whether I need to be physically somewhere or run everything virtually from home. I shouldn't let the comfort of home stop me. </p><p>The other big priority in life, at this stage, is getting married. Although I still believe I don't need to rush. The family seems to be in a rush. This year, if anything, I should find someone. Loud and clear. I don't know if two things can run in parallel. If I find the right people and crack this, life will be so good. </p><p>I want to keep my health running on autopilot, leaner, faster, fitter, and peaceful me. </p><p>Financially, I want to do well in the first half. I don't know what I will end up doing in the 2nd half. I won't be on a paycheck. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">I had to decide this. I have decided. This is the time</span>. (22nd December update)</p><p>I would love to have a hobby and learn a musical instrument. And continue playing some cricket. But I don't know. I want the work of my lifetime to be good. Efforts so good that when I fail, I can look at myself and smile. </p><p>Note: This is still raw. I will let it cook. I might still do a job, but that should be the last step towards building my own thing. FDE, Sales Engg, AI Engg, etc, are the roles I will be interested in. Let's see 🤞</p><p> </p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on January 5, 2026</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/tags/life_updates/">life</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2F2026-manifesto.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2F2026-manifesto.html&amp;via=thebstar13&amp;text=2026%20pondering%C2%A0" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2F2026-manifesto.html" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=2026%20pondering%C2%A0 https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2F2026-manifesto.html" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><img src="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/media/website/Screenshot-2026-01-05-at-10.44.19-PM.png" loading="lazy" height="734" width="722" class="bio__avatar" alt="Bikram Sutar"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/authors/bikram-sutar/" rel="author">Bikram Sutar</a></h3><div class="bio__desc"><p>Hey, I am Bikram.
