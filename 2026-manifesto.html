If anything, 2026 is the year I want to try my luck at building something new. There are probably two big priorities in life. Probably only one when I look at things from purely my own lens. I want to build something great. Something useful, something that creates value. I was saying the same things last year. Didn't do anything. Got settled into a job instead, to be honest. I have been doing great at my job. But probably not the best work of mine. </p><p>The other big priority in life, at this stage of my life, is getting married. Although I still believe I don't need to rush. The family seems to be in a rush. This year, if anything, I should find someone. Loud and clear. </p><p>I want to keep my health running on autopilot, leaner, faster, fitter, and peaceful me. </p><p>Financially, I want to do well in the first half. I don't know what I will end up doing in the 2nd half. I won't be on a paycheck. I had to decide this. I have decided. This is the time. </p><p>I would love to have a hobby and learn a musical instrument. And continue playing some cricket. But I don't know. I want the work of my lifetime to be good. Efforts so good that when I fail, I can look at myself and smile. </p><p>Note: This is still raw. I will let it cook. I might still do a job, but that should be the last step towards building my own thing. FDE, Sales Eng, AI Eng, etc, are the roles I will be interested in. Let's see 🤞</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on November 21, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2F2026-manifesto.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2F2026-manifesto.html&amp;via=thebstar13&amp;text=2026%20Manifesto%C2%A0" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2F2026-manifesto.html" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=2026%20Manifesto%C2%A0 https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2F2026-manifesto.html" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/authors/bikram/" rel="author">Bikram Sutar</a></h3><div class="bio__desc"><p>Hey, I am Bikram.
