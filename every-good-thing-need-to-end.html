It isn't life-changing. Everyone knows this. And some practice this, some can let things go on need basis. I am talking about doing this more actively. Doing a regular check-in to give myself a final push to let go of things, things I would believe at the time, feeling like a burden. </p><p>I need to do this because, as humans, we get so used to holding on to things. And even when our mind knows we need to let things go, it holds onto them for different reasons. I have set up a recurring meeting for a more frequent check-in. I need to do this more actively, as to end up where I want to be, I need to reinvent myself faster than ever. </p><p>Things I need to let go of -</p><p><strong>SpaceOS advisorship ✅</strong></p><p>I have been advising SpaceOS on their tech and everything else for some time. It had good potential to be a good company. But not realized. It isn't a big commitment, but I think it is my time to let it go. It isn't a big commitment and tempting to hold onto, but it is time to let it go. Even the tinniest commitment would make me feel responsible. And maybe steer me out of my actual focus. </p><p><strong>The wedding photography unit 🌕</strong></p><p>I have some hold on a wedding photography unit. I need to let it go. I need to let my brother or Pawan run it fully. It is very small and has a tiny possibility of getting my attention. It is currently taking my energy. And I haven't been excited to give energy there. </p><p><strong>What else? Money?</strong></p><p>I lend money sometimes to friends and family. I am not good at following up. And sometimes when I expect the money to be returned, it sits on my head. I shall transfer all accounts to my brother and let him handle them. Maybe an app like Khatabook should work better, too? 🤔. I shall try. Okay, for the past I should use some tracking. For anything new, I shall re-route to my brother. I can still lend to people where I don't really need to think. </p><p>I called this good things, but not everything I need to let go might be good and shiny. If I am holding onto them, they must have been good at some point. </p><p><strong>Home comfort ✅</strong></p><p>Oh, I have already left that. Maybe someday I want to get back. I still believe it isn't worth it.  I am hardly made for the metros. A peaceful place where I know people. A home from where I can see people walking by the road, and people who are known, people who would send a loud cheer. Don't get me started. I have left home comfort. I need to use every night I spend outside to take myself closer. But I don't know when. This is my fear of exploring the states. That place is too good and can be tempting to make me settle there. It can give many perks, if that is supposed to happen, I don't know. Let me try to break my leg here first. </p><p><strong>And do I have to say I am letting go of my job 🤫 ✅</strong></p><p>The last month on it, it was really good till it lasted. </p><p> </p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on February 14, 2026</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/tags/life_updates/">life</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fevery-good-thing-need-to-end.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fevery-good-thing-need-to-end.html&amp;via=thebstar13&amp;text=Every%20good%20thing%20need%20to%20end" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fevery-good-thing-need-to-end.html" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Every%20good%20thing%20need%20to%20end https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fevery-good-thing-need-to-end.html" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><img src="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/media/website/Screenshot-2026-01-05-at-10.44.19-PM.png" loading="lazy" height="734" width="722" class="bio__avatar" alt="Bikram Sutar"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/authors/bikram-sutar/" rel="author">Bikram Sutar</a></h3><div class="bio__desc"><p>Hey, I am Bikram.
