My website and blogs were in one place. To write a blog I had to open my terminal and a code editor. This was a huge friction. And slowly as I mentioned earlier, Whatsapp notes took over. I started taking notes on Apple notes, Whatsapp self-DM, and on my iPad.</p><p>Updating the website and blog was always in my mind. So much that, I started building a blog engine. Visual blog builder. It worked. It can create basic page with a visual rich text editor. <a href="https://github.com/theBstar/blogder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Still a prototype - find it on github here</a>. As I started using it, I found it needs a lot of features. Initially plan was to just build the features. But I have limited time. And I wanted to build a blog engine to just start blogging again. I wanted to build it, such that I didn't have to open my terminal and IDE to dump something. Fortunately, <a href="https://getpublii.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">I found Publii, a public open-source static CMS</a>. It does exactly this. I can write without touching terminal, IDE, without thinking deployment, and it connects to github pages. YaY 🥳 !</p><p>I am back at writing online. It is fun again. Now, I had to update the homepage. <a href="https://v0.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">V0.dev</a> has been one of the best things on frontend in recent times. I coded up the initial page with just a few touches. And <a href="https://www.thebstar.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the updated website is also live - same old url thebstar.com.</a> 🚀</p><p>I have picked up a really good pace in the last 2 weeks. This blog is just the tip of it. Just a sneak peek into my builder energy picking up. Will be sharing more soon!</p><p>Cool, lets do some small talk. I went shirt-less twice in a crowd last week. I was attending a funeral of a friend's dad. Last rituals were on the bank of a river. We took a bath afterwards. Later in the week, I went to singri to do nets practice on Saturday (21st September 2024). Went shirt-less again due to heat and sweat. I have some fotage from the session, and I look good. I hadn't seen some of those muscles (I still have to look hard though 😅). Motivation to hit the gym. 💪 I have missed the gym for last 3 weeks completely. Had to do some travel. Will tell the story later. This is already long and it is almost 1am now. </p><p>Take care!</p><p> </p><p> </p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on September 23, 2024</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/tags/life_updates/">life</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fpersonal-website-is-live.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fpersonal-website-is-live.html&amp;via=thebstar13&amp;text=Personal%20website%20is%20live%20%F0%9F%9A%80" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fpersonal-website-is-live.html" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Personal%20website%20is%20live%20%F0%9F%9A%80 https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fpersonal-website-is-live.html" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/authors/bikram/" rel="author">Bikram Sutar</a></h3><div class="bio__desc"><p>Hey, I am Bikram.
