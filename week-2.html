I should mostly start running physically and get myself closest to running mentally. This is what week 2 is all about. If I do it well, there will be Bangalore Diwali celebrations to end the week. I don't have much idea about the celebration, though. I will update this on Monday, 28th October 2024. </p><p><strong>Nov 3rd, Sunday 2024, PST</strong></p><p>I am in SF for the next two weeks for company work. Things have changed. I haven't made any progress on building the product or talking to people. I missed hitting the gym for the entire week.</p><p>It was a short working week. In the latter half, I went for a few cricket games. I have been reading 'The Clear Thinking,' which is very much in line with Thinking, Fast &amp; Slow. </p><p>It was a very messy week to summarize, or I can't summarize. Stay tuned for updates from SF. One of my friends suggested I should use more social media. Blogging isn't a great medium for uploading pictures. If I end up taking enough good pictures, I will think. </p><p><strong>Nov 9th, Saturday 2024, PST</strong></p><p>It has been a busy week. Early morning runs / walks, work, evening naps, Sightseeing IST standup, phone, laptop, sleep 🔁 repeat. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Week 3, 11th Nov to 17th 2024</strong></p><p>---- Wish I had filled this up, But there was barely anything new here. ----</p><p>Worked from room &amp; office a few days a week. Got back to proper building after some time. Played a hell lot of cricket. Played 4 matches in a weekend. I don't think I can beat that, neither I want to. </p><p>Thats How the November went. And first 2nd week of December too. </p><p> </p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on December 30, 2024</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/tags/daily/">daily</a></li><li><a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/tags/fokat/">fokat</a></li><li><a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/tags/life_updates/">life</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fweek-2.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fweek-2.html&amp;via=thebstar13&amp;text=November%20-%20Week%202%2C%203%20%26%204%20%F0%9F%8F%83%E2%80%8D%E2%9E%A1%EF%B8%8F" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fweek-2.html" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=November%20-%20Week%202%2C%203%20%26%204%20%F0%9F%8F%83%E2%80%8D%E2%9E%A1%EF%B8%8F https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fweek-2.html" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/authors/bikram/" rel="author">Bikram Sutar</a></h3><div class="bio__desc"><p>Hey, I am Bikram.
