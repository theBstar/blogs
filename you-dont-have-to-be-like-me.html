But remember this: <strong data-start="371" data-end="388">you’re not me</strong>. You’re different. And because you’re different, you’re not limited by my constraints.</p><p data-start="213" data-end="474">Note: I read the quote on the internet, don't know much about Oscar.</p><h2 data-start="481" data-end="524"><strong>The Conversations That Made Me Reflect</strong></h2><p data-start="526" data-end="732">The last couple of weeks have been intense on the work front. Our team was selected among the top 20 globally by the <strong data-start="643" data-end="661">G20 TechSprint</strong>, and we were racing towards our final submission on August 31, 2020. But this post isn’t about that.</p><p data-start="769" data-end="887">I want to share two conversations from last week that stuck with me - one with my brother and the other with a friend. My brother asked how I manage to <strong>stay so focused for long stretches</strong>. The truth is, I don’t always. Yes, to some extent, I’m consistent, but life isn’t a straight line. Plans are worthless if you can’t adapt. I’ve had to change my approach many times while keeping the bigger goal in sight.</p><p data-start="1175" data-end="1412">Conversation about focus and consistency can be done another day. Here, I want to double on - <strong>Comparing yourself to others rarely makes sense</strong>. Different people have different skills, abilities, circumstances, and priorities - all of which shape who they are.</p><p data-start="1419" data-end="1451"><strong>Comparison Isn’t Always Bad</strong></p><p data-start="1453" data-end="1548">Now, I’m not saying comparisons are useless. But if you choose to compare, do it consciously, with enough information and a set of very specific goals.</p><p data-start="1550" data-end="1622"><strong data-start="1550" data-end="1620">Know who you’re comparing yourself to, and more importantly, why.</strong></p><p data-start="1624" data-end="1894">When you answer the <em data-start="1644" data-end="1649">why</em>, you stay aligned with your goals.<br data-start="1684" data-end="1687">For example, I run a bit. But it makes no sense for me to compare myself to Eliud Kipchoge or Usain Bolt. I'm not a professional athlete, and running a sub-2-hour marathon isn’t on my life’s priority list.</p><p data-start="1896" data-end="2068">Where I do compare myself is within my craft - to great software developers and builders. Not to feel inferior or chase someone else’s life, but to <strong data-start="2044" data-end="2065">learn and improve</strong>.</p><p data-start="2070" data-end="2213">When done right, comparison can be a tool - structured, positive, and intentional.<br data-start="2152" data-end="2155">But for me, it’s optional. It’s a bonus, not the baseline.</p><h2 data-start="2220" data-end="2248">What’s a Priority List?</h2><p data-start="2250" data-end="2336">You’ve seen me mention the <strong><em data-start="2273" data-end="2288">priority list</em> </strong>a few times here. Let me explain what I mean.</p><p data-start="2338" data-end="2481">It’s a list of things I want to do before my last blink.<br data-start="2400" data-end="2403">And yes, a lot depends on hope and assumption, like your expected lifespan. The idea is to ask yourself:</p><blockquote><p data-start="2483" data-end="2608">If I knew I had X years left, what would I want to accomplish before my time runs out?<strong data-start="2514" data-end="2606"> </strong></p></blockquote><p data-start="2483" data-end="2608">Or with the framework of abundance, ask</p><blockquote><p data-start="2483" data-end="2608">If I had unlimited resources and time, what would I be doing?</p></blockquote><p data-start="2610" data-end="2756">Make a list. Continue refining this list until you narrow it down to a handful of goals that truly matter to you. It could be one big mission or a few meaningful pursuits.</p><p data-start="2758" data-end="2892">Break those down into smaller, actionable steps.<br data-start="2812" data-end="2815">Sort those tasks by importance or urgency.<br data-start="2857" data-end="2860"><strong data-start="2860" data-end="2890">That’s your priority list. </strong>And it should evolve constantly, with you. At any given moment, the top item on your list is what deserves your focus.</p><p data-start="2894" data-end="3004">And it is okay, if you couldn't come up with a good list of items you want to be working on. Do the opposite of it, make a list of items you don't want to work on. And don't do them. The world is big enough and will find its way to run itself; you take care of yourself.</p><p data-start="2894" data-end="3004">As Bill Gates once said -</p><blockquote><p data-start="2894" data-end="3004">Focus <em>is about saying no to hundreds of good ideas to persist with one. </em></p></blockquote><h2 data-start="3011" data-end="3029"><strong>That's it</strong></h2><p data-start="3031" data-end="3212">This is a brief article, and there’s much more I could say about building and maintaining a priority list. I’ll probably write a detailed one later, with examples and templates. But for now, give it a try.</p><p data-start="3245" data-end="3380"><strong data-start="3245" data-end="3279">And above all - remember this:</strong><br data-start="3279" data-end="3282">You’re unique. You’re independent.<br data-start="3316" data-end="3319">You don’t have to live your life trying to be someone else. Look deep enough inside and you will find answers. </p><p data-start="3382" data-end="3408">Be you. Enjoy being you. <strong data-start="3410" data-end="3424">Stay safe.</strong></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on July 8, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/tags/life_updates/">life</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fyou-dont-have-to-be-like-me.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fyou-dont-have-to-be-like-me.html&amp;via=thebstar13&amp;text=You%20Don%E2%80%99t%20Have%20to%20Be%20Like%20Me" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fyou-dont-have-to-be-like-me.html" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=You%20Don%E2%80%99t%20Have%20to%20Be%20Like%20Me https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fyou-dont-have-to-be-like-me.html" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/authors/bikram/" rel="author">Bikram Sutar</a></h3><div class="bio__desc"><p>Hey, I am Bikram.
