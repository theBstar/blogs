You don't even believe in god! - This is how they would react to the title. Yes, I don't believe in the traditional definition of God. Most of them sound very selfish and human. Can't be someone who created the universe. Then, do I believe someone created the universe? I don't know. This is a very blurry line. But I respect people's beliefs - it is important to call out early. </p><p>You might have gotten an idea already; This isn't a spiritual guide. By God, I mean the really good quality work, the dedication, and countless hours that go unnoticed. Honesty in the process is the path to get there. It leads you to the God. It motivates you to stay strong, keep pushing, get better, and see God. </p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navaratri" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Navratri</a> is going on. My mom is deeply spiritual. (Spiritual and religious are different; She might be in between, actually). She is fasting these nine days. Sleeping on the floor. She even developed shoulder pain in the last two days. People were suggesting she should sleep in bed today. I went on to check before locking my room. She is still beside her Durga maa pratima on the floor, in a deep sleep. She might be in a little pain tomorrow, but the peace she has today beats everything. </p><p>What is stopping her from sleeping on the bed?  No one is watching or judging her. It is her. She is making the call. She has made a promise, and she will keep it. It might not be all comfortable, but she will do it till she can. And these honest, pure heart - no fluff efforts are what I feel are paths to god. She can't agree more.</p><p>Similarly, in work or academics, these no-fluff hours separate the Best from the good. Honesty in the process and honesty with self are paths to great work. </p><p>✌</p><p> </p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on October 6, 2024</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/tags/daily/">daily</a></li><li><a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/tags/fokat/">fokat</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fhonesty-leads-you-to-god.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fhonesty-leads-you-to-god.html&amp;via=thebstar13&amp;text=Honesty%20leads%20you%20to%20God" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fhonesty-leads-you-to-god.html" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Honesty%20leads%20you%20to%20God https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fhonesty-leads-you-to-god.html" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/authors/bikram/" rel="author">Bikram Sutar</a></h3><div class="bio__desc"><p>Hey, I am Bikram and this is my blog. </p></div></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/v03-t15.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><figure class="content__nav-image"><img src="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/media/posts/12/responsive/Screenshot-2024-10-04-at-11.01.10-PM-xs.png" class="lazyload" loading="lazy" alt="Clock - representing changing time" height="734" width="734"></figure><div><span>Previous</span> V.03 - T15</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/the-third-person-view.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> The third person view</div><figure class="content__nav-image"><img src="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/media/posts/14/responsive/Screenshot-2024-10-09-at-12.26.02-PM-xs.png" class="lazyload" loading="lazy" alt="A thread with ChatGPT on how people use - Talk about A when they actually want to talk about B.
