It is going to be new. It is the need of the hour; we either go extinct or evolve with the tools. I guess going extinct isn't an option, not in my world. Welcome evolution. This is a living document/journal for the evolution. </p><p><strong>July 24th 2025</strong></p><p>I was in an interview, and my peers asked this question to the candidate: Given that I give you an open-ended problem, how would you spend the first 24 hours? What would you do? This is an interesting question and gives so much about how people think through problems, that's their framework for solving. Some of these pieces or the entire stack is changing fast in the AI-first world. I have been thinking about this for some time. Time to put a structure around it, maybe I am not yet ready to put a structure, but let's start brewing at least. </p><p>The candidate answered by saying - I would go do research, look at competitors, understand users, and would like to build a mind map around the problem. Mind map sounds so familiar, in fact, for everyone I hired, onboarded, I have given them initial space to go build their mind map and intuition of the space. I have personally done this myself so many times. It is hard to sell anything to me unless I am convinced to buy. I like to build my intuition on the product, whether I need to buy, similarly, what is the problem, why is it worth solving, and why now? Why us? What exactly does solving the problem mean? Building intuition and a mind map around connections. In the age of AI, what part of this can be delegated? What part of this is a good problem for AI? Building intuition is important, but it is also time-consuming &amp; biased towards my existing understanding/experience. And if AI works, what do I do with the free time? Do I start working on another idea? And come back once AI is done. My context switching needs to be better. As I would still like to build intuition, maybe better &amp; more efficient. How do I do this? </p><p><strong>July 27th 2025</strong></p><p>This is timely, as I have a few things to brainstorm, plan coming week. I should try to do them with tools and figure out how/where my mental model needs an upgrade. I have worked so much with these tools, and have even done a couple of conversation sentiment analyses. I don't know if anyone does this. But I had some hunches and wanted another opinion. The way I am looking at them right now is different. </p><p><strong>August 3rd 2025</strong></p><p>We have a hackathon this week, will have a lot of time to think about this. I shall make a lot of time to think about this. </p><p><strong>August 8th 2025</strong></p><p>I have mostly relied making changes on ai this week. Because I could afford, because I wanted to try. </p><ul><li>It has done good job at search. It has done good job at finding approaches. </li><li>It hasn't done a good job at implementation, it has still struggled with context. And with more ai writting these data, more diluated their data set will become for rich information. </li><li>Humans with expertise, rich information/skills will always bend ai to will, it will be just another tool.</li><li>No super agi, not in this architecture. Maybe not in this pricing. </li></ul></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on August 8, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fa-new-kind-of-thinking-model.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fa-new-kind-of-thinking-model.html&amp;via=thebstar13&amp;text=A%20new%20kind%20of%20thinking%20model" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fa-new-kind-of-thinking-model.html" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=A%20new%20kind%20of%20thinking%20model https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fa-new-kind-of-thinking-model.html" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><img src="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/media/website/WhatsApp-Image-2025-01-20-at-9.28.12-AM.jpeg" loading="lazy" height="1600" width="768" class="bio__avatar" alt="Bikram Sutar"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/authors/bikram-sutar/" rel="author">Bikram Sutar</a></h3><div class="bio__desc"><p>Hey, I am Bikram.
