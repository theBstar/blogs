It is going to be new. It is the need of the hour; we either go extinct or evolve with the tools. I guess going extinct isn't an option, not in my world. Welcome evolution. This is a living document/journal for the evolution. </p><p><strong>July 24th 2025</strong></p><p>I was in an interview, and my peers asked this question to the candidate: Given that I give you an open-ended problem, how would you spend the first 24 hours? What would you do? This is an interesting question and gives so much about how people think through problems, that's their framework for solving. Some of these pieces or the entire stack is changing fast in the AI-first world. I have been thinking about this for some time. Time to put a structure around it, maybe I am not yet ready to put a structure, but let's start brewing at least. </p><p>The candidate answered by saying - I would go do research, look at competitors, understand users, and would like to build a mind map around the problem. Mind map sounds so familiar, in fact, for everyone I hired, onboarded, I have given them initial space to go build their mind map and intuition of the space. I have personally done this myself so many times. It is hard to sell anything to me unless I am convinced to buy. I like to build my intuition on the product, whether I need to buy, similarly, what is the problem, why is it worth solving, and why now? Why us? What exactly does solving the problem mean? Building intuition and a mind map around connections. In the age of AI, what part of this can be delegated? What part of this is a good problem for AI? Building intuition is important, but it is also time-consuming &amp; biased towards my existing understanding/experience. And if AI works, what do I do with the free time? Do I start working on another idea? And come back once AI is done. My context switching needs to be better. As I would still like to build intuition, maybe better &amp; more efficient. How do I do this? </p><p> </p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on July 24, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fa-new-kind-of-thinking-model.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fa-new-kind-of-thinking-model.html&amp;via=thebstar13&amp;text=A%20new%20kind%20of%20thinking%20model" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fa-new-kind-of-thinking-model.html" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=A%20new%20kind%20of%20thinking%20model https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fa-new-kind-of-thinking-model.html" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/authors/bikram/" rel="author">Bikram Sutar</a></h3><div class="bio__desc"><p>Hey, I am Bikram and this is my blog. </p></div></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/the-heist-of-the-century.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><figure class="content__nav-image"><img src="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/media/posts/34/responsive/Kid-In-Magician-Hat-Sitting-On-Pile-Of-Cash-xs.png" class="lazyload" loading="lazy" alt="" height="832" width="832"></figure><div><span>Previous</span> The Heist of the Century</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/expectations-reality-happiness-and-peace.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Expectations, Reality, Happiness, and Peace</div><figure class="content__nav-image"><img src="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/media/posts/36/responsive/Screenshot-2025-07-27-at-7.44.07-PM-xs.png" class="lazyload" loading="lazy" alt="Ladder to Another Place" height="736" width="736"></figure></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>❤️ @thebstar</p></div><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://x.com/thebstar13" aria-label="X"><svg><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thebstar/" aria-label="LinkedIn"><svg><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg></a></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
