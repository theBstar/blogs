What does it mean to be consistent with the routine? With the time, efforts, or results, what does consistency mean in day-to-day life?</p><p>Does it mean doing x thing every day without missing out? Yes. If you can do it every day. There are some extraordinary people who can do incredible things every day. Or some extremely consistent people can do the same thing every day, whatever, or however silly the repeating task is, the feat of doing the same thing every day is incredible. But for most people, everyday doesn't really mean "everyday". </p><p>There will be time, and always there will be time, in a loop, that you will miss out on a few days. With great things, great routine, new things you are trying, even when it is addictive, you will miss out on it one day. Consistency in life is defined by how quickly you can come back on track. You missed the routine yesterday. Can you be on it today? Two things - </p><ol><li>How fast can you realise you missed it</li><li>And how fast can you put yourself back on track</li></ol><p>Consistency and focus aren't a single long continuous line. They are actually one, one dashed line, where dashes and spaces between them are of different lengths. And the longer your dashes are, and the smaller your empty spaces are more consistent you are. </p><p>It is okay to miss out. Get back on track and keep hammering (Probably Shub owns the trademark for hammering). ⚡</p><p> </p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on August 31, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fconsistency.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fconsistency.html&amp;via=thebstar13&amp;text=Consistency" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fconsistency.html" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Consistency https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fconsistency.html" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/authors/bikram/" rel="author">Bikram Sutar</a></h3><div class="bio__desc"><p>Hey, I am Bikram.
