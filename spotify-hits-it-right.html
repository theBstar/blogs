Just right on the spot. It would be very rare for me to share them. Maybe if I am very close to some people, I will curate and share if pushed for, maybe if I have more confidence someday, I will share them here. Yes, you are thinking right, I say too many "maybe", maybe. <a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/i-speak-of-probabilities.html">I speak of probabilities</a>, or maybe I am scared of absoluteness. Probabilities give me an absolute optimistic obsession. There is even a slight chance, even when I am on my deathbed, that I will maybe hit the lottery. That's why. </p><p>I am in Bangalore, and it is almost midnight. It is my usual time to wrap up the day. But every once in a while, it is also my time to jot these thunders in my cerebral cortex. This is an endeavour to understand myself, this is a practice to keep myself accountable, this is a way to have a tick. Maybe it is a way to run away sometimes. Maybe there are too many metrics to track, and the Heisenberg principle applies, whether it be a simulation or quantum reality. </p><p>I have always felt I have limited time. I am blessed with a brilliant system (body + mind). But thoughts of not having enough time, and thoughts of not doing enough, can wake me up in deep sleep. If couciousness find ways after the biological fullstop, I might wake up again. Maybe that is the circle I am running in if there is any truth. I want to be nobody in the world, I don't want to make noise, I want to do my part and walk away, call me a penguin. But I want validation from my inner core, I am somebody. I have done something that was justification to the system I possess and not just the situation, environment that gave me what it could. Never in my life have I had two voices. Not saying I don't run into conflicts. </p><p>We were in Arunachal last weekend. Driving in mountain is a growth lesson. Walking itself is a growth lesson. Stability is at its peak when I am standing on two feet. But to move, I have to pick one, and another. We have to risk stability for moving. It is so common and repetitive that we don't even think, unless you have tried walking on a really slippery floor. Driving in the mountains is similar. You start from the bottom, go through a really curvy road, a risky turn, and reach the top. The view is amazing. But you know, the destination is 3 mountains beyond. Next thing, you go down the mountain you just climb but on the otherside. You let go of progress for a cause, for a future you haven't seen. But maybe you don't care about the future; the journey itself matters. Destiny isn't the top of the first mountain, may it be the bottom of any other. Progress happens like this. </p><p>Maybe it is my time, maybe it is my year, but funny it is, I don't know what to do. I know what not to do as a starting point. Maybe I don't need to do a job. Maybe it is the time of war. Maybe a few more months. Let me prepare by doing a shadow, or maybe let me rest up. I don't know. Maybe my month will bring the answers. </p><p>See ya!</p><hr><p><strong>Ready to fight</strong></p><p>Wake me up at night<br>Take me to the fight<br>To the underworld<br>In the dim light<br>Where I can get high<br><br>I am no shy<br>Born to fly<br>Give me a piece<br>The price is the peace<br>Let Hades know<br>He is finished<br>Here to fight<br>The prize is the peace<br><br>It is gonna hurt<br>I am no fart<br>Give me the fight<br>I am gonna ignite<br>Light so bright<br>World gonna scream<br>Look at my bhai<br><br>Wake me at night<br>In the dim light<br>Take me to underworld<br>Ready to fight</p><p><a href="https://suno.com/s/lIrVhCNWD51rwIGs">https://suno.com/s/lIrVhCNWD51rwIGs</a></p><p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2AB7fsbG0eZJjDGile69CQ?si=Dfv66H1rQx29KLGDSTB5Rg">https://open.spotify.com/track/2AB7fsbG0eZJjDGile69CQ?si=Dfv66H1rQx29KLGDSTB5Rg</a></p><p> </p><p> </p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on January 31, 2026</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/tags/life_updates/">life</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fspotify-hits-it-right.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fspotify-hits-it-right.html&amp;via=thebstar13&amp;text=Spotify%20hits%20it%20right" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fspotify-hits-it-right.html" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Spotify%20hits%20it%20right https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fspotify-hits-it-right.html" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><img src="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/media/website/Screenshot-2026-01-05-at-10.44.19-PM.png" loading="lazy" height="734" width="722" class="bio__avatar" alt="Bikram Sutar"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/authors/bikram-sutar/" rel="author">Bikram Sutar</a></h3><div class="bio__desc"><p>Hey, I am Bikram.
