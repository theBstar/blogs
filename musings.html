AI is hot. VR and AR are catching up, and network latency is going down. It is a great time to be a technologist. It is still 2025, and things are moving so fast. LLMs, at least, are getting better, almost 2x efficient every 6 months. Where is it gonna head in 2026, 27, and beyond? </p><p> </p><p>Let's assume we don't crack human thinking and emotions. Or we don't trust a model to do it. Let's say it is early 2027. What is hot now?</p><p>- AI is a tool, no more a technology - Students, teachers, doctors, lawyers, everyone uses AI.</p><p>- What is coding? No one knows. Sure, people who started early know. And you still have to code in academics. But no need to learn a syntax, language to build software if you know English. And why only English? If you know how to explain, be clear and thorough, you can build software. </p><p>- Natural language is vague, but at the same time, it gives a lot of flexibility in terms of personalisation. Say - Websites are described, machines know user preferences, and build the ui on the fly. What do apps look like then? Data store, apis? Oh, are these the super smart browsers that're running the world?</p><p>- Cursor can build apps for devs. How do consumers build their apps? Do they need to be building their apps? What do those apps look like?</p><p>- Re-learning how to use a computer would be required for everyone, as human-computer interaction is going to change so much.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on July 4, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fmusings.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fmusings.html&amp;via=thebstar13&amp;text=Musings" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fmusings.html" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Musings https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fmusings.html" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/authors/bikram/" rel="author">Bikram Sutar</a></h3><div class="bio__desc"><p>Hey, I am Bikram.
