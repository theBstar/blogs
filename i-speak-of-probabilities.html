It feels like a good checkpoint to explain the concept of nothingness. It is my own opinion of nothingness. It is maybe my ideal model of nothingness. It doesn't mean I am capable of practicing everything I am going to say here. </p><p><strong>Life probably has no meaning</strong></p><p>It is hard to imagine this, life running without meaning. We are the lone conscious species in the universe that we know of. Feels like an extremely unlikely random event. How can we exist without meaning? </p><p><strong>I speak of probabilities</strong></p><p>If I recall, in 2020, I started realizing, I don't control everything. Even for the simplest of actions/explanations, it is impossible to be 100% certain. I would like to argue, I can be close to 100% certain. And from my limited pov, I can be closer to 100%. And I have, for simplicity, consciously used certainty instead of confusing people. How can I predict certainty when I am uncertainly uncertain?</p><p><strong>Life probably has a meaning</strong></p><p>Contrary to what I said earlier, maybe life has a meaning.  Each of our lives. This is a much easier and natural way of living. Maybe more harmony in this. Maybe it doesn't require extreme detachment to still live peacefully, and keep making progress where we don't know the road. </p><p><strong>The meaning of life</strong></p><p>Why do you need the meaning of life? What is the most atomic question we are trying to answer? Who am I? Before asking why am I? Maybe it is easy to answer who I am. Maybe both questions/answers supplement/complete each other. The most important thing here is "I". </p><p><strong>"I" is the consciousness</strong></p><p>Dig deeper into the eye. Connect with it. Embrace it. "I" is you; it is within. Most of us operate from a very shallow surface of "I". We only know the tip of the iceberg. Once we have enough activated consciousness, maybe our answer to life will start appearing. Maybe we will learn to ask the right questions. </p><p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong></p><p>Does it really matter if life has a meaning? If life is so random, my occurrence in life is unfathomably random, and so my consciousness, and everything that matters. Maybe finding these atomic units is gonna connect to the big picture. </p><p>There are two possibilities - life is planned, or life is random. If life is intended (which we ignored earlier), anyway, everything matters. Focusing on consciousness is still gonna lead us individually. If it is random, everything ends in nothingness, most likely. </p><p>Be because you want to, be because you must. Because you can't be anything else. </p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on December 30, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fi-speak-of-probabilities.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fi-speak-of-probabilities.html&amp;via=thebstar13&amp;text=I%20speak%20of%20probabilities!" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fi-speak-of-probabilities.html" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=I%20speak%20of%20probabilities! https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fi-speak-of-probabilities.html" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><img src="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/media/website/WhatsApp-Image-2025-01-20-at-9.28.12-AM.jpeg" loading="lazy" height="1600" width="768" class="bio__avatar" alt="Bikram Sutar"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/authors/bikram-sutar/" rel="author">Bikram Sutar</a></h3><div class="bio__desc"><p>Hey, I am Bikram.
