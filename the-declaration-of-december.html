In a way, for people old enough, it's time to circulate those "Happy New Year in advance" messages 😅. And for grumpy people, it is the time to wonder what exactly to be happy about another round of the sun. Isn't it just a completely random point in time and space? I will leave that conversation to those groups fighting for it. I wish a beautiful Christmas to people who celebrate. Who doesn't and can afford a small reset, let it be. For me, it is a month to double on my goals. And finish the year strong. </p><p>In an infinitely long timeline (barely a few thousand years that we remember and maybe another few thousand before we disappear), there must be markers to rest, reset, push, drive, go crazy, and sometimes celebrate. Markers to remember and revisit. The calendar is probably humans' first ever time machine. I'm not sure if it is natural, because when I think of going back, I think of moments, not dates. Some people recall moments by dates, but I doubt that is intuitive, without reasoning, for most. </p><p>Let me crank the time machine and go to the start of the year. Let me revisit the goals - </p><ol><li>I wanted to have visible abs and take a photo by year's end</li><li>I wanted to learn Sanskrit</li><li>I wanted to do a lot of builds</li></ol><p>I have made progress on all fronts. 3 is a continuous item. I am going to focus on 2, and judge myself this month on whether I can do them or not. I am back to my preset, and <strong>this is the declaration - </strong></p><ol><li>I want to have abs and take a photo. I am in the best shape, and this is the best time to do this.</li><li>I want to record a small video on Sanskrit. As proof. </li><li>I want to recover completely from the sprain. And do my first run to celebrate the new year. </li></ol><p>I had planned to do a lot of running, short intervals, and do a high-calorie deficit diet to lose fat. I am in good shape. Losing 3/4kgs and a heavy focus on core would have been enough, I thought. I twisted my ankle yesterday. And from the looks of it, it will take 3/4 weeks to recover. I can't run. I walk with discomfort. I will have to find another way to achieve the same results. The good thing is I can't play cricket, so I don't have to go outside. I can be invisible at home. And lock in for December. </p><p>It is gonna be fun, this is one of the most exciting Decembers. Great things await on the other side. Happy new year in advance 🤣</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on December 1, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fthe-declaration-of-december.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fthe-declaration-of-december.html&amp;via=thebstar13&amp;text=The%20declaration%20of%20December" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fthe-declaration-of-december.html" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=The%20declaration%20of%20December https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fthe-declaration-of-december.html" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/authors/bikram/" rel="author">Bikram Sutar</a></h3><div class="bio__desc"><p>Hey, I am Bikram.
