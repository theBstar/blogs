            "content_html": "<p>This has been a realization lately: every good thing needs to end. It isn't life-changing. Everyone knows this. And some practice this, some can let things go on need basis. I am talking about doing this more actively. Doing a regular check-in to give myself a final push to let go of things, things I would believe at the time, feeling like a burden. </p>\n<p>I need to do this because, as humans, we get so used to holding on to things. And even when our mind knows we need to let things go, it holds onto them for different reasons. I have set up a recurring meeting for a more frequent check-in. I need to do this more actively, as to end up where I want to be, I need to reinvent myself faster than ever. </p>\n<p>Things I need to let go of -</p>\n<p><strong>SpaceOS advisorship ✅</strong></p>\n<p>I have been advising SpaceOS on their tech and everything else for some time. It had good potential to be a good company. But not realized. It isn't a big commitment, but I think it is my time to let it go. It isn't a big commitment and tempting to hold onto, but it is time to let it go. Even the tinniest commitment would make me feel responsible. And maybe steer me out of my actual focus. </p>\n<p><strong>The wedding photography unit 🌕</strong></p>\n<p>I have some hold on a wedding photography unit. I need to let it go. I need to let my brother or Pawan run it fully. It is very small and has a tiny possibility of getting my attention. It is currently taking my energy. And I haven't been excited to give energy there. </p>\n<p><strong>What else? Money?</strong></p>\n<p>I lend money sometimes to friends and family. I am not good at following up. And sometimes when I expect the money to be returned, it sits on my head. I shall transfer all accounts to my brother and let him handle them. Maybe an app like Khatabook should work better, too? 🤔. I shall try. Okay, for the past I should use some tracking. For anything new, I shall re-route to my brother. I can still lend to people where I don't really need to think. </p>\n<p>I called this good things, but not everything I need to let go might be good and shiny. If I am holding onto them, they must have been good at some point. </p>\n<p><strong>Home comfort ✅</strong></p>\n<p>Oh, I have already left that. Maybe someday I want to get back. I still believe it isn't worth it.  I am hardly made for the metros. A peaceful place where I know people. A home from where I can see people walking by the road, and people who are known, people who would send a loud cheer. Don't get me started. I have left home comfort. I need to use every night I spend outside to take myself closer. But I don't know when. This is my fear of exploring the states. That place is too good and can be tempting to make me settle there. It can give many perks, if that is supposed to happen, I don't know. Let me try to break my leg here first. </p>\n<p><strong>And do I have to say I am letting go of my job 🤫 ✅</strong></p>\n<p>The last month on it, it was really good till it lasted. </p>\n<p> </p>",

            "content_html": "<p>As the sun goes to deep sleep and a full moon hits its peak, as everyone goes to bed, and when I am sleepy, it is midnight, my Spotify hits it right. Just right on the spot. It would be very rare for me to share them. Maybe if I am very close to some people, I will curate and share if pushed for, maybe if I have more confidence someday, I will share them here. Yes, you are thinking right, I say too many \"maybe\", maybe. <a href=\"https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/i-speak-of-probabilities.html\">I speak of probabilities</a>, or maybe I am scared of absoluteness. Probabilities give me an absolute optimistic obsession. There is even a slight chance, even when I am on my deathbed, that I will maybe hit the lottery. That's why. </p>\n<p>I am in Bangalore, and it is almost midnight. It is my usual time to wrap up the day. But every once in a while, it is also my time to jot these thunders in my cerebral cortex. This is an endeavour to understand myself, this is a practice to keep myself accountable, this is a way to have a tick. Maybe it is a way to run away sometimes. Maybe there are too many metrics to track, and the Heisenberg principle applies, whether it be a simulation or quantum reality. </p>\n<p>I have always felt I have limited time. I am blessed with a brilliant system (body + mind). But thoughts of not having enough time, and thoughts of not doing enough, can wake me up in deep sleep. If couciousness find ways after the biological fullstop, I might wake up again. Maybe that is the circle I am running in if there is any truth. I want to be nobody in the world, I don't want to make noise, I want to do my part and walk away, call me a penguin. But I want validation from my inner core, I am somebody. I have done something that was justification to the system I possess and not just the situation, environment that gave me what it could. Never in my life have I had two voices. Not saying I don't run into conflicts. </p>\n<p>We were in Arunachal last weekend. Driving in mountain is a growth lesson. Walking itself is a growth lesson. Stability is at its peak when I am standing on two feet. But to move, I have to pick one, and another. We have to risk stability for moving. It is so common and repetitive that we don't even think, unless you have tried walking on a really slippery floor. Driving in the mountains is similar. You start from the bottom, go through a really curvy road, a risky turn, and reach the top. The view is amazing. But you know, the destination is 3 mountains beyond. Next thing, you go down the mountain you just climb but on the otherside. You let go of progress for a cause, for a future you haven't seen. But maybe you don't care about the future; the journey itself matters. Destiny isn't the top of the first mountain, may it be the bottom of any other. Progress happens like this. </p>\n<p>Maybe it is my time, maybe it is my year, but funny it is, I don't know what to do. I know what not to do as a starting point. Maybe I don't need to do a job. Maybe it is the time of war. Maybe a few more months. Let me prepare by doing a shadow, or maybe let me rest up. I don't know. Maybe my month will bring the answers. </p>\n<p>See ya!</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Ready to fight</strong></p>\n<p>Wake me up at night<br>Take me to the fight<br>To the underworld<br>In the dim light<br>Where I can get high<br><br>I am no shy<br>Born to fly<br>Give me a piece<br>The price is the peace<br>Let Hades know<br>He is finished<br>Here to fight<br>The prize is the peace<br><br>It is gonna hurt<br>I am no fart<br>Give me the fight<br>I am gonna ignite<br>Light so bright<br>World gonna scream<br>Look at my bhai<br><br>Wake me at night<br>In the dim light<br>Take me to underworld<br>Ready to fight</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://suno.com/s/lIrVhCNWD51rwIGs\">https://suno.com/s/lIrVhCNWD51rwIGs</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/2AB7fsbG0eZJjDGile69CQ?si=Dfv66H1rQx29KLGDSTB5Rg\">https://open.spotify.com/track/2AB7fsbG0eZJjDGile69CQ?si=Dfv66H1rQx29KLGDSTB5Rg</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

Political parties/candidates declaring manifestos, something we have grown accustomed to. It is a worldwide practice. Often, they fail to accomplish what they state. It is ambitious. All I can say, assuming true intentions. </p>\n<p>I had a plan for the whole year. I used to have one every year. Instead of writing a plan, I am writing a manifesto this year. I will try to make it very clear, very actionable. This should define me in the long run. 2026 is not only an election year, but it is also the year for me. 26th is my birthday. I recently got a jersey that says 26 😅. I wasn't thinking about 2026 - honestly. </p>\n<p>For yearly goals, I want to break them down into three themes (<a href=\"https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/2026-manifesto.html\">Read how I baked these</a>) - </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Leverage - If anything, I want this badly this year. I failed at this last year. </li>\n<li>Health - I was super on this last year. I want to double down on health. </li>\n<li>Family, friends, and fun - I should have fun, and people with/around me. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Things in 1 &amp; 3 are clearer. Let me explain the last one. We will crawl back to others afterwards. Whenever I turn into real execution, I start feeling more detached. I like being detached and not needing to depend on others. <strong>I don't want to miss out on moments of life for this. If this is gonna stop me from great things. Let this be it</strong>. And it is a huge thing for me to come here and say this. I marked the sentence bold. I want to be there for people I care about. I want to be there for moments (for things they care about). I want to check on friends. Maybe making a few new friends as well.</p>\n<p>I want to have fun. Extreme challenges give me fun. They induce chaos in my life. Chaos that I can control and eventually feel on top. Like a fast of 30 hrs with all normal daily activities. Doing an HM without much prep, committing to have abs in a month. Deciding to learn Sanskrit.  I want to have a social impact. Last year, I moved to a more individual level focus, and I am gonna continue doing the same. </p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1je7e171hbr\">Time for the actual goals 🛎</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Leverage\n<ul>\n<li>Knowledge work (Related to what I do daily - involves my time directly) \n<ul>\n<li>I want to hit a total of 2027 users on my products by the end of the year. Just users. Don't need to be paid. </li>\n<li>Above is the ultimate goal; if that doesn't happen, <strong>I want to have proof that I did the right process, and the process is a minimum of 12 product releases</strong>. Do all of this in public. </li>\n<li>The above will add to my knowledge. It will add to the speed of iteration and learning. It will eventually help me to find the thing I want/can jump into.  </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Traditional businesses (Indirect/passively managed)<br>\n<ul>\n<li>I want to have at least 1 business by the first quarter of the year. By the end of March. I shall have one person at least to manage it for me. 3 by the end of the year.</li>\n<li>This has been a fantasy at the same time, I think there are many good untapped opportunities here. If my goal is to be near people, why not? In some way, once matured, I can use this to give back. </li>\n<li>[<strong>Feb 5</strong>, too early to drop, but I am not sure now]</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Health\n<ul>\n<li>Dead straight 😅</li>\n<li>Run 21 min 5k - Stamina, endurance, and more anaerobic </li>\n<li>I am going to focus more on flexibility and movements this year\n<ul>\n<li>Be able to hold a handstand for 27 sec</li>\n<li>Do a bridge and return from the bridge without any support</li>\n<li>Biggest one - do a split. I give myself 1 year. Should be enough, right? Let's see. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Fun\n<ul>\n<li>I don't know how I quantify this yet. I need more time. (5th Jan 2026). </li>\n<li>Maybe throw an exciting challenge every 60 days. Can be learning, can be physical endurance. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1je7e171hbt\">Updates 🔊</h3>\n<p class=\"msg msg--info\">⚠️ Personal space alert. Updates for each week. Raw access. Don't share, don't quote without running it by me, please 🙏</p>\n<p>As usual, this Article will have the goals and progress updates each week.</p>\n<p>Here we go. 🚀</p>\n<h4 id=\"mcetoc_1jhd7j20l6\">Week 7 (14th Feb)</h4>\n<p>Writing this from Delhi. It is my stoppage before Udaipur. Came to meet Sajal &amp; family. Treated really nicely here. Jaipur was good too. But I had to travel a really long distance for sightseeing. I prefer walking, and short distances. I am lazy if I have to be in an auto for an hour to visit a place. Jaipur was a large city, and to top that, the forts are far away from the city. Other attractions are mostly nearby. I had great home-cooked food there. Delhi is huge + crowded as usual. I don't have a liking towards this kind of a city. </p>\n<h4 id=\"mcetoc_1jglt8npi2\">Week 6 (5th Feb)</h4>\n<p>Hello 👋 from Jaisalmer. Not much to update, very laid back tourist, vacation city. I don't really see the energy. I am sleeping at 1/2 regularly and waking up at 7/8. Not sustainable for me. So? I am heading out early, Jodhpur next. Ideally, I just want to fly to Bangalore; I feel like wasting time here. It is the phase of life, I guess. Also, the hotel doesn't have a chair, I could go to tarrace to work from. But cool. It is a different experience. On the otherhand, it is a new experience. I have liked the colours of the city. Repeating nth time 😀. Jodhpur, Pushkar - where I am meeting Shyoji and his friend. Then maybe Delhi, or Udaipur - depends. </p>\n<p>The LinkedIn article went live, good response. I am planning to build on them more. Maybe not all articles, but some long posts. But consistent. Creating more visibility for myself. </p>\n<p><strong>I might have a plan finally</strong></p>\n<p>I might have a plan and clarity on what to do now. It is still not very different from what I wanted to do earlier. But with more focus. </p>\n<p>- Focus on building B2C ideas. Spend no more than 10 days on one. Spend the next 2 weeks marketing, and also keep building a new one during that time. This way, I will have 2 releases every 30 days. </p>\n<p>- Am I gonna make money? Is there a chance something might hit? Potentially. But this will tighten the loop for my learning. It is a different world. Building, Marketing is gonna change - I need to re-learn these skills. If any big idea comes, it will come from these small iterations. </p>\n<p>- This was the focus: what is changing? The way I would approach. I have a ads budget now if required. I have a budget for AI. Oh, I should set these numbers. </p>\n<p><strong>8th Feb</strong></p>\n<p>More warming up, had an interesting conversation with Sidhant, <a href=\"https://open.substack.com/pub/collectivewisdom/p/building-software-from-point-solutions?utm_campaign=post-expanded-share&amp;utm_medium=post%20viewer\">He did a write up</a>. Got connected to a few VCs. I don't know if I need VCs, needs its own post. Anyway, I am in Pushkar and gonna meet Shyoji after a while. </p>\n<h4 id=\"mcetoc_1jga29og5c\">Week 5 (27th Jan)</h4>\n<p>Met a few friends. Mostly, that's been the week. I am more convinced I should not do the job, although it is a good job, pays decently, has good people, good culture, and I am doing impactful work. I am deciding if I should wait till April, so I have a little extra cash and see one appraisal cycle here. I have decent money to run myself for a year, on the other hand. I should decide to be in Bangalore till mid of this year, irrespective of what I am gonna do. Let me sleep on this for some time and see where my mind goes. </p>\n<p><strong>Jan 31st</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, I will be in Bangalore till April this year, at a minimum. Life is gonna be one-directional, that's it. Till april, I try building on the side and selling. I have found a few contacts who have been selling on the side. I will set up talks next week. </p>\n<p>I have a half-marathon run tomorrow morning. Run starts at 6. I have a flight at 1. I have to reach the airport by 11.30, and I will have 30 minutes to drop my bag. This means I have to be at the hotel by 9.30 head towards the airport as soon as possible. It might take an hour for the race to the hotel. I have exactly 2 hour 10 min to finish the race if it starts at 6, till 8.10. I must get out of there by 8.20 no fluff. It will be one of my hardest runs. I don't have the right tools, I don't have any prep - well, I have eaten extra for a few days. It is a challenge, so I am running. Let's see, if I can't finish in time, I should head back to the hotel anyway. ✊</p>\n<p><strong>I have started writing LinkedIn articles</strong>. I will write 12 in the next 12 weeks; the first one goes live this Wednesday. This is mostly for brand building. I must tell the world subtly, time to time, how good I am. Is that what we do?</p>\n<p>I will start everything else the day after tomorrow. Need to re-pack now. </p>\n<p><strong>1st Feb</strong></p>\n<p>I finished the race in 2:08, and left for the hotel at exactly 8.20. Am I a neurosurgeon to be this precise? The route was quite hilly, with an elevation of 210 meters. I had completely dead shoes. No bounce whatsoever. I ordered a pair of insoles and put them in my old Asics Cumulus 23. Calves took a heavy shot, and so did the groin. But feels good, I can still wake up and run a half-marathon. These are just good things compounding. I am in Jaisalmer today. Will be here for a few days. Then visit nearby cities before heading to Udaipur. Peace!</p>\n<h4 id=\"mcetoc_1jfjdhl3sq\">Week 4 (22nd Jan)</h4>\n<p>Back after ages. I am not very well. Got a cold. It has disrupted my schedule a bit for the last 3 days. But not everything is bad. We went to Aruncahcal last weekend. It was me, Baba di, Anita (cousin), and Tanuj. It was fun, it was a thrilling adventure as Annita mentioned. She thanked me for being brave and coming on a trip in an unknown place and hilly road with two girls and a silly boy. I have never thought like this. I have always belived man and women to be equal (apart from biological limits) and sharing the same privileges. But yeah, the world is different. I have a lot of respect for women who go out of their way, out of their comfort zone, to fight. Be it having different roles in the house or going to space, based on context and aspirations, I would always bow down to them with respect. Equality, I imagine, where women are safe and empowered to think alike and beyond, I don't know where and when it will happen. Anyway, it was a fun trip. It was cold, and I am still recovering from a cough. </p>\n<p>I am flying to Bangalore this weekend. A few senior leaders of the company are going to be in the city. From Bangalore, I will fly to Jaisalmer and spend most of the next 20 days in Rajasthan. Shubhankar is getting married, and I am going to attend his wedding in Udaipur on 20 and 21st.<br>Looking forward to this as this is the longest I will be travelling. I will have to pack smart. </p>\n<h4 id=\"mcetoc_1jeup74f77\">Week 3 (14th Jan) 🐌</h4>\n<p>Adding a mid-week update. I got a cold in the early half. And took it easy on the 13th. Also played a few short tennis ball cricket games, put in all efforts to bowl fast. My body is still recovering one day after. I got a little slower on work as I thought I could after having a really crazy (good) last week. But I shouldn't, as I slowed at work, I slowed at my projects. But it has been a decent week, back to the crazy pace again. Oh, our team has a match in the APCC qualifier tomorrow, but I am not playing - I promise not play on weekdays (if I had done the release for the month, I would have thought). And, I had signed up for a different team in Udalguri. I didn't enjoy playing there much. I feel I shouldn't take another spot, because my first preference here was Udalguri. I saw better opportunities there initially; everything has a price. As much as I would like to preach, people know me in Tezpur, and there is a high chance they will stop me in the actual league. Let's kick hard the next two days. </p>\n<h4 id=\"mcetoc_1jekio4rc1d\">Week 2 (Week of 5th Jan) ⚡</h4>\n<p>Jan 5th, the Plan is set for the year 🎉. I have half-built a cricket coach app. I have half-built an eye exercise website. The Eye exercise website, at this stage, is more like a lead generation place. I shall release this by the 2nd week. It is a quick win. </p>\n<p><strong>8th Jan</strong></p>\n<p>I had a game planned today. I had earlier planned to play this tournament. The quality of cricket was lower than what I had expected. Plus, it was today, on Thursday. I have promised myself not to play a game on weekdays unless I am done with my release for the month. Or it is a tournament match in Tezpur or Dhekiajuli, so I don't have to travel, and I can wrap up my work and cricket on the same day. </p>\n<p>I have made a note app. I needed it to make notes on my iPad. It is close to completion as well. I am hoping to release this month. I have ordered a few electrical components to just play with things. I might order a 3d printer if I keep my energy up like this for the next 2 months. It is a good week. Let's keep rolling.</p>\n<p><strong>10th Jan</strong></p>\n<p>Mass used to use granola at LD. I used to use Fathom. For data &amp; privacy reasons, we are only going to use tools for which we have gotten a contract. But I like my note taker. The problem isn't the AI; it is the data going elsewhere. So, <a href=\"https://x.com/thebstar13/status/2010046944123728291?s=20\">I built my own AI note taker today</a>. Runs completely locally with open source models. It was a pursuit to build something for me &amp; also to get my hands dirty with Claude code. Too much on X. Meh, a nothing surprising, gotta use with skill before I rate. Skill is the alpha IG.</p>\n<p>Feels like a month, I have a lot of things, maybe all half polished, unless I use them daily, no one else is gonna use them. Have to start replacing my tools with my own. </p>\n<p>Also did some personal reflections triggered by a conversation. Processing it, gonna sleep on it for a few days. In 2024, I realised I needed to live more in the present. Extension of the same is I need to meet people at their present, not past, not future. <a href=\"https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/self-note-present-is-real.html\">Nothing but preset is real</a>.  </p>\n<h4 id=\"mcetoc_1jfjdj8sqs\">Week 1</h4>\n<p>The week was all reflections, partying, and planning. </p>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1je7e171hbs\">Questions 🤔</h3>\n<p>Laying out frequently asked questions. </p>\n<p><strong>Biggest question - Do I get married this year? 😅</strong></p>\n<p>I would love to be in a position to answer the person, more than the event. As soon as that happens, the event will follow. Parents want it to happen. If I manage to do well on my first theme in the first quarter, I might do this. If I don't do well there, I must leave my job to do well. I don't think that would be a good time for any new person. </p>\n<p><strong>Do I leave my job?</strong></p>\n<p>As I answered above, I leave my job if - </p>\n<ol>\n<li>I have enough clarity. I found something</li>\n<li>If I don't iterate as much as I like to. If I don't have 3 product releases in the first quarter. </li>\n<li>Even when I don't leave my job, it doesn't mean I do the same job - keeping the switch open. </li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Do I play cricket?</strong></p>\n<p>I like playing cricket. I believe in the practice of great things requiring sacrifices, not animal sacrifices. I am not allowed to play cricket on weekdays (when my job is on). I am allowed to play on the off days, or if it is a T20 nearby and doesn't disturb my schedule. Or if I magically get to play abroad 😅. I am allowed to play on weekdays if my work is on track, and I have already done the release for the month. I would still have to log the days. Not exceed 12 days in 12 months. </p>\n<p><strong>Do I shift my base?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>If I find something and it requires me to shift for a few months - yes.</li>\n<li>If I don't do well on my leverage targets in the first quarter. </li>\n</ul>",

I haven't even touched 1%. This is a negative. I was conscious about this in December and put in my efforts in giving. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Highlights</h2>\n<p>The following are the major highlights that I remember. Some of them are things I wanted to do, some of them happened and resulted in some good impact - </p>\n<p><strong>Work</strong></p>\n<p>I was part of a winning team at a hackathon at work. This makes it the second successive year of winning at least one hackathon. </p>\n<p>I wanted to switch my team and move on to more horizontal impact work. I switched to data viz that is going to be used by all products inside LaunchDarkly. </p>\n<p>A senior Alexis told me, Business wants you to do something, you want to do something. Find something that is fun for you, that you want to do, and that aligns with the business. If you don't find spare time to tweak around and have fun. It is equally important to have fun. I have been blessed to find the intersection and have pure fun. Thanks to Alexis. And Tiffany later. And seeing people like Alexis, Zach sets the bar high. </p>\n<p><strong>The SF trip brought clarity</strong></p>\n<p>I was in SF at the start of the year and saw 500 people in a room. Saw how big organisations organize these events. Saw how a trained CEO or any senior leader brings in clarity. 1. They show you a clear vision, and 2. They have very clear steps to the vision. 3. If each step is trackable, it is going to be more effective. I have been practicing it. This was my takeaway from the trip. Yeah, the city was beautiful. And probably one of the cities I won't mind living in for a long time.</p>\n<p>Dan Rogers, CVO, Manish, and Sonesh were the people I saw and had a chance to interact with. Mainly, Dan and CVO were infectious. Shub and Div have been infectious all along. </p>\n<p><strong>A dull month</strong></p>\n<p>It is rare for me to have a dull month. But I had a few. It was probably around March, I started talking to someone. And I surrendered to the idea of getting married. I surrendered and said Whatever it is, I am gonna make it work. She was very pretty, maybe the prettiest, and very innocent. Maybe the most innocent girl I have met to date, in this case. But something wasn't clicking. I was dragging it.</p>\n<p>In July (🤔), I was in Kolkata. I was reflecting on whether I should continue. I visited a few places - the Botanical Garden, the Indian Museum. I got a message from a friend (now a friend) out of nowhere. Sometimes people can do so much to you without them knowing. She did that to me. I received her message. Replied to her. Immediately, Wrote a message to the girl above. We had a call later, and I let her know how/why I felt it wasn't going to work. Because of this friend (SA), I was able to drop the baggage, I felt lighter, back on my feet. I owe her a big thank you and a big gratitude message 🙇</p>\n<p>I might have walked away from above at some point, as I know myself. Or maybe not because I had surrendered. I don't know. But SA made it happen real quick for me. Never a dull moment in life. This brought me a different kind of clarity. I have been carrying it; it contributed to my life outside as well. A marker is that my cricket, running, and fitness have improved. Maybe my work too, but I take work religiously, hence it would go well irrespective of outside life. </p>\n<p>Edit: Hold your horses, my friends. Nothing special here. </p>\n<p><strong>Hit a peak</strong></p>\n<p>I thought people would slow down in their 30s. And I had in some sense started to slow down. But around Dussera, I hit a peak. I am in a flow state after that. I have a lot of energy. Mentally physically. Above is one contributor, maybe. And 2nd was that I found more impactful work. I feel like I am in my early 20s. Even when I get injured, I recover so fast. ⚡ Since I have tasted this, I am not gonna go back. </p>\n<p>I was in the zone, and started doing things, or maybe I was doing things and got into the zone. I was doing runs, physical activities, reading, and some creative writing or drawing, etc. I had good work. I had let go of my social responsibilities just around that time. That had started to feel like a burden as I hated politics compromising social institutions, and I realised it wasn't a fight worth fighting at this stage. </p>\n<p><strong>More than words, intention matters</strong></p>\n<p>I am reading Gandhiji's autobiography. He mentions how words can be misused, misdirected to convey different meanings. But when you promise, when you make a pact to be true, you should be true to the intention. This has hit me. I am going to be true to my intentions more to others. To myself, I am gonna make sure that while setting goals, I don't leave room for different meanings. </p>\n<p>Intentions and specific words combined with clarity should have radical effects in goal settings and getting them done. </p>\n<p><strong>Chaos to settle</strong></p>\n<p>Expectedly, I am ending the year with more chaos and more uncertainty. I have the next few weeks before I lock in 2026. Chaos should settle, and the execution should take over. It is okay to have chaos if execution continues to be excellent. Maybe I thrive in Chaos. </p>\n<p><strong>Fun</strong></p>\n<p>2025 was fun. Khushi (sister in law) got transferred. I have a sister at home. Everyone is happy. A lot of friends got married. Danced a lot 😅. Now they say it is our turn! It isn't happening soon. Astrology differs, Mom says. Only if I allow it. Who knows? </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/hmgt6FLy9aI?si=DHDxrg2SHoiHusHR\">Made some videos</a>. </p>\n<p>26th is my birthday, and I have gotten a jersey that says 26 😅. So it is gonna be a fun year next. Have fun 🎉</p>\n<p> </p>",

I am just journaling. </p>\n<p>I have mentioned many times to people that I manifest good energy for myself. It is very true. I feel I have manifested many things, many moments. All good. Mostly good. The 23rd of December 2025 sparked a different thought. Capturing it here, in case I come to this again. </p>\n<p>I saw an accident while returning from cricket practice. I helped the victim to the hospital. He is fine now. If I do any manifestation, I manifest good things, I manifest being good, being useful, I manifest being resourceful. I manifest being helpful. Hear me out, if I am manifesting my reality, is there a possibility I am manifesting these scenes subconsciously, so I can be helpful?</p>\n<p>I prefer enablement over on-demand help. But even then, there is a feeling of being useful in being helpful. This is more reactive, low-hanging than enablement. Success in helping is more controlled, more defined. Many factors go out of hand in enablement. </p>\n<p>Sounds like borderline craziness. But let's not think I will be helpful. I shall still be open to help. Not seeking to help. Would this change no of scenes I see? If it doesn't, would it be because I will manifest less, or would it be because my body will somehow give it away?</p>\n<p>Cray! Good that I don't do this actively, all happens unconsciously, and I just get a spark for a second. Usually, they are useful. Sometimes they are as crazy as this. Again, good that nothing is active. Almost like I can give instructions to unconsciousness and it executes. So I can be somewhat sane actively. </p>\n<p>Time to hit the bed. Exciting days. I am in a PTO and doing fun stuff. </p>",

We are the lone conscious species in the universe that we know of. Feels like an extremely unlikely random event. How can we exist without meaning? </p>\n<p><strong>I speak of probabilities</strong></p>\n<p>If I recall, in 2020, I started realizing, I don't control everything. Even for the simplest of actions/explanations, it is impossible to be 100% certain. I would like to argue, I can be close to 100% certain. And from my limited pov, I can be closer to 100%. And I have, for simplicity, consciously used certainty instead of confusing people. How can I predict certainty when I am uncertainly uncertain?</p>\n<p><strong>Life probably has a meaning</strong></p>\n<p>Contrary to what I said earlier, maybe life has a meaning.  Each of our lives. This is a much easier and natural way of living. Maybe more harmony in this. Maybe it doesn't require extreme detachment to still live peacefully, and keep making progress where we don't know the road. </p>\n<p><strong>The meaning of life</strong></p>\n<p>Why do you need the meaning of life? What is the most atomic question we are trying to answer? Who am I? Before asking why am I? Maybe it is easy to answer who I am. Maybe both questions/answers supplement/complete each other. The most important thing here is \"I\". </p>\n<p><strong>\"I\" is the consciousness</strong></p>\n<p>Dig deeper into the eye. Connect with it. Embrace it. \"I\" is you; it is within. Most of us operate from a very shallow surface of \"I\". We only know the tip of the iceberg. Once we have enough activated consciousness, maybe our answer to life will start appearing. Maybe we will learn to ask the right questions. </p>\n<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong></p>\n<p>Does it really matter if life has a meaning? If life is so random, my occurrence in life is unfathomably random, and so my consciousness, and everything that matters. Maybe finding these atomic units is gonna connect to the big picture. </p>\n<p>There are two possibilities - life is planned, or life is random. If life is intended (which we ignored earlier), anyway, everything matters. Focusing on consciousness is still gonna lead us individually. If it is random, everything ends in nothingness, most likely. </p>\n<p>Be because you want to, be because you must. Because you can't be anything else. </p>",

And for grumpy people, it is the time to wonder what exactly to be happy about another round of the sun. Isn't it just a completely random point in time and space? I will leave that conversation to those groups fighting for it. I wish a beautiful Christmas to people who celebrate. Who doesn't and can afford a small reset, let it be. For me, it is a month to double on my goals. And finish the year strong. </p>\n<p>In an infinitely long timeline (barely a few thousand years that we remember and maybe another few thousand before we disappear), there must be markers to rest, reset, push, drive, go crazy, and sometimes celebrate. Markers to remember and revisit. The calendar is probably humans' first ever time machine. I'm not sure if it is natural, because when I think of going back, I think of moments, not dates. Some people recall moments by dates, but I doubt that is intuitive, without reasoning, for most. </p>\n<p>Let me crank the time machine and go to the start of the year. Let me revisit the goals - </p>\n<ol>\n<li>I wanted to have visible abs and take a photo by year's end</li>\n<li>I wanted to learn Sanskrit</li>\n<li>I wanted to do a lot of builds</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I have made progress on all fronts. 3 is a continuous item. I am going to focus on 2, and judge myself this month on whether I can do them or not. I am back to my preset, and <strong>this is the declaration - </strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>I want to have abs and take a photo. I am in the best shape, and this is the best time to do this.</li>\n<li>I want to record a small video on Sanskrit. As proof. </li>\n<li>I want to recover completely from the sprain. And do my first run to celebrate the new year. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>I had planned to do a lot of running, short intervals, and do a high-calorie deficit diet to lose fat. I am in good shape. Losing 3/4kgs and a heavy focus on core would have been enough, I thought. I twisted my ankle yesterday. And from the looks of it, it will take 3/4 weeks to recover. I can't run. I walk with discomfort. I will have to find another way to achieve the same results. The good thing is I can't play cricket, so I don't have to go outside. I can be invisible at home. And lock in for December. </p>\n<p>It is gonna be fun, this is one of the most exciting Decembers. Great things await on the other side. Happy new year in advance 🤣</p>",

For someone like me, speed of learning and iteration matters. It needs to be high. As I gave myself some time in December to live as I want this year, mentally, I have realised a few things. I will start by sharing what I did. I limited my focus. I was spending time on Sanskrit and health. But my main focus was building something and/or finding someone to build with. I talked to 3 people. One of them was the founder of Dukan. He had an early exit. I have been looking for someone like him (more experienced in running the business, having experience in raising funds &amp; getting distribution). But when I started talking, unless for a few very specific domains, it is hard for me to commit to an existing idea. It needs to be a combination of excellent people + really impacting, deeptech, or personal problem for me to commit fully. And commit without having many expectations. </p>\n<p>Hence, before jumping full-time without having anything and figuring it out, I want to figure something out or have a close idea of whatever that is, and then jump full-time. I am gonna make it simple and make it a focus. </p>\n<p>I think I am ready to write my 2026 goals. See you there 👋</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>22nd of December</strong></p>\n<p>I have half-built an AI cricket coach. I have a working pipeline, need to producctionize it. I built a useless macOS app to light up faces in calls, yes, it is a ring light. I have done meaningful work at LD. Have been instrumental in shared dataviz. Maybe there is a space in the AI config I can explore for a few months. </p>\n<p>I have taken a long break in December. 22nd to 1st of Jan. Actual off started on 21st of December (Saturday). This has made me realize I can maybe still have a job and iteration on a few ideas inside. Have jobs as options and pick the most fun option; the other dimension being finances. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>21st of November</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are plenty of options, among everything I choose you. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There were options, and there will be. If anything, 2026 is the year I want to try my luck at building something new. There are probably two big priorities in life. Probably only one when I look at things from purely my own lens. I want to build something great. Something useful, something that creates value. I was saying the same things last year. Didn't do. Got settled into a job, to be honest. I have been doing great at my job. But probably not the best work of my life. </p>\n<p>To have the best chances, I need to widen my net. I need to be doing many things until I hit something. I need to find people, circles who are on the journey. I need to figure, whether I need to be physically somewhere or run everything virtually from home. I shouldn't let the comfort of home stop me. </p>\n<p>The other big priority in life, at this stage, is getting married. Although I still believe I don't need to rush. The family seems to be in a rush. This year, if anything, I should find someone. Loud and clear. I don't know if two things can run in parallel. If I find the right people and crack this, life will be so good. </p>\n<p>I want to keep my health running on autopilot, leaner, faster, fitter, and peaceful me. </p>\n<p>Financially, I want to do well in the first half. I don't know what I will end up doing in the 2nd half. I won't be on a paycheck. <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">I had to decide this. I have decided. This is the time</span>. (22nd December update)</p>\n<p>I would love to have a hobby and learn a musical instrument. And continue playing some cricket. But I don't know. I want the work of my lifetime to be good. Efforts so good that when I fail, I can look at myself and smile. </p>\n<p>Note: This is still raw. I will let it cook. I might still do a job, but that should be the last step towards building my own thing. FDE, Sales Engg, AI Engg, etc, are the roles I will be interested in. Let's see 🤞</p>\n<p> </p>",

            "content_html": "<p>I didn't know there was a test match going on yesterday (14th Nov, 2025). I barely watch cricket these days. I still follow it a bit. I opened Hotstar out of temptation and watched a few overs. I don't exactly remember the details, but I know SA got all out and India came to bat. The day ended early due to bad light. I don't recall the details because I was multitasking. I was working and watching the match passively. I am not good at passively consuming something. I know people who are really good at this. And I had some thoughts running at the same time. </p>\n<p>I am an old soul. In the age of T20 cricket and all the glaze, I prefer test matches.  In the age of show and making loud noises, I prefer being sustained and silent. Don't get me wrong, I am every bit opposite to what a traditionalist would be. I don't follow structures; I don't follow institutions for the sake of it. I am on my deathbed, have no chances of surviving, and you give me a way out, even in that situation, you will find me asking why, how? A simple answer like trust me would be enough if I <strong>could</strong> trust you. </p>\n<p>I am so free, I do everything that makes sense to me, everything that seems interesting. I am so free, yet I am in a <strong>cage</strong> of my own. Multiple cages, actually. Okay, they aren't cages; they are boundaries set by me, for my core. For the values, for me. Cage may be an oversimplification. Easy for other people to understand. Maybe they are cages, and I can't help to get out. I can't get out. Better, I don't want to get out. I would know there is a socially better outcome outside of these cages, but I can't help. I am never sold to social outcomes; I want to fly, but in my own free world. I am free when I know I haven't twisted, played with my values. Most free versions are the ones that don't even need to <strong>unsee</strong>. And irony, I have been blessed to <strong>see</strong>. </p>\n<p>To be continued...</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Today, October 23, 2025, is Bhai Tika. We, the people of the Nepali community, celebrate bhai tika on the last day of the Tihar festivals. Sisters put a seven-colour tika on the brother's forehead. Praying for their long life and prosperity. There are many such festivals in our community, celebrating the bond between brothers and sisters. </p>\n<p>I am not religious. And a lot of our festivals are very strongly tied to religions. Although some new age people try to find a different meaning and decouple festivals and religions. Maybe they should be separated, but every ritual there carries such significance; not sure if they can be separated. And a lot of rituals in festivals are actually rooted in nature worship, so not sure if they should be separated. Coming back to festivals, as I said, I am not religious. But I like all festivals. And as I live with people who deeply believe in religions, I try to follow all rituals, all sane rituals associated with the relevant festival. Festivals are wonderful ways to celebrate life, bonds, and experiences. They are wonderful to stop, be grateful, appreciate, and celebrate life. Life itself is so worthwhile that, should be celebrated every day. I feel grateful to be living, I feel joyous, I feel spirited, I feel loved, I feel loved, I feel cared for. I feel connections, I feel people around me, I miss the people who left, and I am excited for new people to come and join. It is an endless journey that I am part of. I feel humbled, meaningful, and at peace. Every celebration is the feeding of this positivity to my brain. It is the required nutrition for the brain to churn out more positivity. It is the fuel to manifest a similar reality. </p>\n<p>If I have to visualize my writing, they are never a straight line. So is life, and so our thoughts. Maybe I will structure them if I ever plan to write a book. I don't know. Should I structure them? As long as I am raw, and people have access to thoughts flowing (original versions), I don't have a problem in making them more accessible. Communication is about relay, then telling. But this is my space. My musings. I don't need to be structured. I can open my editor and start writing. I can start dumping. I know where I am going, or sometimes I know a point in a journey, the journey itself is unravelled in the musings. Sometimes, I have a destination and clear starting points as well. But for now, it is a point in time. </p>\n<p>For the last few years, since Jaya has been here (She is my maternal uncle's daughter), she and Tulshi (My paternal uncle's daughter), both in class 11th, 9th now, have been celebrating Rakhi and Bhai tika with a lot of enthusiasm. I feel so elated. Enthusiasm is infectious. I am also infected, what can I say? I celebrated bhai tika with them early in the morning. My mom was heading to her parents' house, father was heading to his sister's house.  Tulshi was heading to her maternal uncle's home. It was decided that the Tika will be celebrated early in the morning at home. This also allowed me to visit my paternal uncle's daughters. They had been inviting me to tika for some time, and I couldn't refuse. Around 10 am, I took my bike out. cleaned it up and headed to their place, a 50km journey. </p>\n<p>24th Oct 2025</p>\n<p>I like riding a bike. Gives me the perfect thrill. There was a time I used to think 2-wheelers are risky, but that was a long time ago. Now, it almost feels like an extension of the body. I feel the gusting wind hitting all over the body, engine thumping, heart pumping more blood, and a rush. The power while overtaking. I started my ride. And was soaking in the feel. On the highway, when I was trying to overtake a truck, the driver spat out Gutkha. It was on my forehead &amp; on my arms. I tried stopping the truck, truck ignored me the first time. But I caught up. Near a speed breaker, I had a chat with the driver. I asked him not to spit like that. He initially said he didn't see me and later apologized. And I carried on. It wasn't a heated conversation. In these kinds of situations, it can very well be a heated conversation. I have started to not pick these small fights that aren't worth it. If I can't change something, is it really worth a fight? The only thing I wanted to change was letting him know I was upset and that he could do better. Hope he does better. In game theory, maybe it is tit for tat with a little forgiveness. And he was a first-time offender. Life goes on. </p>\n<p>Tika was good. At home, I enjoyed it a lot. And at the uncle's place, I enjoyed it equally. I had 3 nieces there, and I enjoyed playing with them a lot. We did a role play, I was their son, a student, and they were preparing me for school and teaching me alphabet sounds in school. I was heading back home, thinking everything balances out, I had a good start, and then the bad incidents. Imagine you being ready, and blushing, and someone spits at you. And then, I had a good time again. I was riding back. A truck again almost hit me. This time, the truck was overtaking another truck, and there was an auto in front of me. Auto turned left to give way to the truck, truck wasn't visible to me initially. I managed to move to the left just in time. Lucky me. Oh, I also met a school batchmate after a really long time, close to my uncle's place, out of nowhere. That was a good time too. </p>\n<p>I was attending <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deusi/Bhailo\">Deusi</a> in the evening when I got a sudden call from my manager. I was on vacation. He called me to congratulate me on a due increment that we were discussing for some time. It finally went through, and from November, it will reflect on my payroll. Well, life truly balances everything out. And there is beauty in seeing the balance. To top this, I then had a really long conversation with a teen from my village, intensely long, like 2/2.5 hours. I had to drop him home later in midnight. At 12 am, I was heading back home on an empty road, some deusi sounds echoing from far. First time I experienced midnight without even 1% of fear. I used to be out at midnight in complete darkness, but I used to have supernatural fear, at least some slight fear somewhere inside. I slept around 1:30 am. A good long day. </p>\n<p>I started with many thoughts yesterday, but I don't feel like completing them all today. One thing I feel is important and I am gonna share is, the last couple of weeks leading to Diwali, I feel so active, so pumped, I shared on the journal, on Twitter, and a few folks. I was finding the reason. The week before Diwali, it was again 3 days of pure power and 3 days of not so much. The days when I felt it were the days that were the most chaotic. Those were the days I had to wake up early and sleep late. And I had challenges in the day. So, chaos on my plate seems like the fuel for the energy. I don't know how sustainable. I don't know if there can be a balance between chaos and peace. I had tried finding the peace and keeping myself super motivated earlier. I am gonna try balancing chaos with peace. Let's see how it goes. I am gonna create busy, packed schedules, and a schedule that I love. </p>",
