And if you read this, don't tell anyone because it is <strong>secret</strong>. And don't even ask me!</p>\n<p>The confession: I have lost my bio-sleep clock. From 2016-2019, magically, I developed this ability to sleep an exact number of hours. Wake up without an alarm. I could sleep and wake up just on time. Every day for the next few years. It sounds weird, but It is true. For the last few months, I have been fighting hard to wake up to my alarm and yet have been missing it so many times! And it has been a quest to get my powers back. </p>\n<p>It feels magical when you have the perfect start to the day. And waking up on time, without an alarm, is part of the perfect start. It gives a really big boost to my day. These small things keep me fresh and more active than any coffee machine. </p>\n<p>As I reflect and write this, I can pinpoint one instance where I nearly missed my flight, and maybe that was the start of losing confidence. Subconscious operating prompts got messed up. Time to rewire. </p>\n<p>Time to set off the alarm to freshen my powers. Time for those timed naps. Time for a perfect start to the day. As I have been always used. </p>\n<p>Time for the perfect sleep now 😴</p>\n<p><strong>October 27th 2024</strong></p>\n<p>I tried removing the alarm and also tried putting a stricter instruction to my brain - that I must wake up at 5.30 am. I am almost there now. Energy is back. The Undertaker needs to raise (I will write on this later)!</p>\n<p> </p>",

This is a live document for week 1. </p>\n<p>Before we start, I have a few goals - </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Setup the place ✅</li>\n<li>Hit the gym ✅</li>\n<li>Cricket practice 2 days a week 🔴</li>\n<li>Eat and sleep well - it is a long game. ✅</li>\n<li>Build the first version of Kidli - Web send to select parents. - Instead did a soft signup launch - got the first signup. 🟡 🥳</li>\n<li>Build the Kidli App (ios/android) - Do a release </li>\n<li>Get 100 paid parents</li>\n<li>Publish articles - Tech, Leadership, learnings - 2 articles a week. 🟡</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note: I might change some in November but until then let's run with these. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Day 0 - Sunday, October 20th 2024</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Received the rejection email from <a href=\"https://www.zfellows.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">ZFellows</a> - Without any traction &amp; a co-founder it was kind of obvious. But hey, It fast-tracked my pitch deck and solidified the space. Talked to a few potential users, which I was delaying otherwise. </li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Day 1 - Monday, October 21st 2024</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Setup wifi, room ✅, few things pending - take delivery of chair, a big bucket since the area seems to have some water issues, bedsheet &amp; a pillow</li>\n<li>Fixed gym - hitting from tomorrow. Found a cricket club - a scheduled match on Sunday. ✅</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">Should have Kidli API running today</span>. 🧑‍💻 Update: Only got basic Azure open ai llm wrapper setup. Didn't complete this. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Day 2 - Tuesday, October 22nd 2024</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Had a good day at work. Did some WebGPU experiments. ✅</li>\n<li>Didn't make much progress on the personal front. </li>\n<li>Okay, went to the gym. First day! ✅</li>\n<li>Caught cold somehow 🥶</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Day 3 - Wednesday, October 23rd 2024</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cold got worse. Wasn't at 100%, to be honest. </li>\n<li>Initially, I thought I would take a complete break, could only sleep so many hours. Later did some experiments at work.</li>\n<li>Yes, Went to the gym. ✅ I picked myself up. I could have had a better day. These cold and all shouldn't stop me. Show up! to Everything, Everywhere committed!</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Mid-week thoughts </strong></p>\n<p>There have been a few observations and thoughts that have slowed things down. But it shouldn't really—time to re-center the focus. I need to release a v0 this week. Even if it means just an LLM wrapper. </p>\n<p>Also, and it is an old realization, My day outside of work is heavily proportionate to my day at work. I should find ways to do the best work at any cost. Or start decoupling these two for the better. </p>\n<p>Looking forward to the next 3 days! And a game on Sunday 🏏</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 - Thursday, October 24th 2024</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rested from gym.  I will share my complete schedule for accountability. I shall update my calendar. And sell myself to the calendar. </li>\n<li>Had a good day at work - solved a few issues, helped fix one critical issue, and ran one good experiment. I am thinking of writing one article tomorrow on at least one experiment I ran in the week. ✅</li>\n<li>My Google Play console account verification was out of date. Updated - it took some time. Hope verification completes soon. 🟡 I would have liked to have at least the auth part solved today, but I couldn't do it. Let's do it tomorrow. I want to see a big check tomorrow. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Day 5 - Friday, October 25th 2024</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not much progress on Kidli</li>\n<li>Work wise a good day. Great demo by the team ✅</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Day 6 - Saturday, October 26th 2024</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Talked to an Edtech expert, with deep expertise in building learning experiences. Provided some references to people working in the space in India.</li>\n<li>Also found Thecuriousparent, thanks to an old friend, Seems like the guy is fighting the exact problem. Would be interesting to talk to. Let's see if I can set up a chat.</li>\n<li>Went deeper reading into b2b sales. Good all-nighter. Slept around 4, back at 8 with full energy. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Day 7 - Sunday, October 27th 2024</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Soft launched Kidli - Updated website, added Google Analytics, added waitlist form &amp; sent to parent groups, and Reddit. I must figure out if I can publicly put it on my socials. Socials reminded me, that I should add social links to the homepage. ✅</li>\n<li> Got one signup. It always starts like 0, 1, ... 🥳</li>\n<li>Had planned to go for a run, but missed. </li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Overall, it was a productive week. Got some work done, plus good food &amp; physical activity. I am writing this at 7.15 pm IST. Had a long screen time today, and I will be reading some books now. </p>\n<p>It is only going to get better from here. 💪</p>",

I did a few business stints while I was in college. 2016 to this day, has been a build-up to making a great one. I hope so 🤞.</p>\n<p>And I feel this is the time. The next step from here - having a crack at building a billion dollar Company. Every calculation I have been running leaves me with only one possible path at this junction of life. Startup!</p>\n<p>I have been blessed to be in tech. If I crack a good product and have revenue streams, it is easier to build a venture-backed business in this space, and scale really fast.

The point is, this is the time.  </p>\n<p>I am flying to Bangalore this Sunday, October 20, 2024, to explore the next phase. I don't know where it will lead me, but I know where I want it to lead me. I don't know if I will be broke by next year, but I know I will be more than fine.  </p>\n<p>I have a fascination with hardship and challenges. I am romanticizing it already. It is a Himalayan peak climb, Mount Everest. But imagine the peak being unique to the climber &amp; the climber doesn't get Sherpas.</p>\n<p>I love the journey, or rather, I love myself enough to endure any journey; I love the peak. And the peak is the true love. </p>\n<p>Love makes it worthwhile.</p>",

Only things beyond 90 inches to certainty. 50/50 is when you aren't sure. 60/40 is still in the uncertainty zone, IMO. Even the 70, on the other hand, is clarity and conviction towards A. If I follow <a href=\"https://www.seedtoscale.com/blog/kunal-shahs-delta-4-theory-of-successful-startups\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Delta 4 framework by Kunal Shah</a>, Here the Delta is 4. It 70/30 clarity rule is even practiced by Amazon in decisions making if I recall correctly. But for critical decisions, where speed still matters, 80/20 is a one. It provides a balance of clarity and certainty. 70/30 for more speed. </p>\n<p>The thought came to me while driving yesterday morning. For A/B with initial weights as x/y and it to be x'/y'.

You can negotiate for a B 4x better for it to win. And when you already have such a strong affinity towards A, sitting on the negotiation table doesn't harm. You come out with a 4x, or you have an A anyway. Who knows if you are even getting a 16x? It absolutely does not harm if you are comparing future optimistic value vs liquidity today.</p>\n<p>Go, use the formula. To make it more robust, you can update it with an inflation factor for money, risk &amp; opportunity cost for new opportunity cost, joy vs regret weightage for emotions, state of mind, etc. </p>",

Giving me enough control to pass by certain vallies. </p>\n<p>I don't like to sit static and react to change. I want to proactive. I want to guide them. I can't control the most part of it. But some vallies I want to visit, I will do everything to steer the engine it to take me there. It is time to steer it again. To new direction. To new valley. </p>\n<p>🚀</p>",

Sajal's product engineering philosophy, combined with close look at how Dhruv (Founder @Orangehealth) operated with clarity on the product, Prathamesh's design explanation, reviews helped me build a product and user first mindset. What do I say about Ateev, he was the one always watching our back. Making it easy. Well, I can go on. How Ayush found all eges-cases on the product. Whatever minimum, I saw of Tarun handling &amp; designing operation excellence. Rajendra Sir with the knowledge. I said I could go on.</p>\n<p>Let's come back to the point. He was replying to this clickbaity tweet. I know where it is coming from. The original twitter means to not fake your status game. Don't show off. I am not here to comment on it. 'Making it' is more important to me. How people handle it after making it is a personal choice. Whether you show off, or play it under the carpet - upto you. If you feel like 'making it' is a journey, we will talk about it later. For now we will stick to 'Faking it till making it', specifically Faking before making it.</p>\n<p>Let's break it down - </p>\n<h4><strong>Making it</strong></h4>\n<p>To make it, you need a goal. You always have to start with a goal. One that you are fully committed to. A goal requires plans. Multiple plans, broken down by different milestones in the journey. Bridging the gap between today and the goal on each steps. You need to put a lot of things together to achieve this. And most important of these is putting your mental game in place. </p>\n<h4>Faking it</h4>\n<p>Yes, faking it. To be a winner you need to start thinking like a winner, work like a winner. Think you are already making it, you are destined to make it. Now, back track honestly from here. Figure out what all are you destined to do. And live it. This is what faking it is. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Let's take a simplified example, </p>\n<p>Goal - Running a sub 20 5k. </p>\n<p>Planning - I have 3 months to run sub 20min 5k. And my current PR is 24 min. I have a plan prepared by an expert coach on Nike run club. The expert coach has already applied back-tracking to prepare the plan.</p>\n<p>Executing the plan, is what it requires now. When I know execution is hard, this is where people give up. Faking can really help here. Everytime I go for a run, I am the sub 20 5k runner completing his traning. Everytime I feel low, I fake it to think how would I the future, who has already run a sub 20 min 5k would pick him up. </p>\n<p>And this is how I weight my risk and opportunities as well.</p>\n<p>All of this is internal. Tricking mind to play the best, live the moment in head to prepare for reality, to bridge the gap. Elite atheletes do visualisations before games, they live the moment way before it actually happens to prepare their future self, by using their fake future self. Oh, are we in a time travel paradox? 😅</p>\n<p>Go, fake it <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">till</span> to make it. </p>\n<p>Cheers. </p>\n<p> </p>",
