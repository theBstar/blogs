First, I needed to get a jar of water to my dad, who was working under the scorching sun on an MGNREGA project, just 800 meters from our house. I raced over, handed him the jar, and was about to head back when he asked me to fill in for him for just 15 minutes while he fed the cows.</div>\n<div dir=\"auto\"> </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"x14z9mp xat24cr x1lziwak x1vvkbs xtlvy1s x126k92a\">\n<div dir=\"auto\">I agreed, although I managed to negotiate it down from the 30 minutes he originally asked for. There I was, shovel in hand, helping to dig a pool. I was annoyed at missing out on time with my friends. Minutes turned into hours, stretching unexpectedly until 4 PM. We were done for the day.</div>\n<div dir=\"auto\"> </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"x14z9mp xat24cr x1lziwak x1vvkbs xtlvy1s x126k92a\">\n<div dir=\"auto\">Walking home, I was furious. I felt tricked and disappointed. I couldn’t even look at my dad when I saw him still working on our farm. In a burst of anger, I threw the water jar aside and vented all my frustrations. That night was restless, filled with rage and tears.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"x14z9mp xat24cr x1lziwak x1vvkbs xtlvy1s x126k92a\">\n<div dir=\"auto\">The next morning, with my anger slightly gone, I decided to go back to work. Maybe part of me wanted to make him feel guilty.</div>\n<div dir=\"auto\"> </div>\n<div dir=\"auto\">I worked the entire day and realized just how much my father did for us. Even the previous day, while I was at the pool, he was still working on the farm. The work at the pool was relatively easier, and there were many others like him, working hard for their families, some only a few years older than me. I realized it was an opportunity to help the hardest-working person I knew. I could still play after 4 PM. I returned home that day and decided to continue working with a smile. For the next 20 days, I worked not out of obligation, but out of deep respect and joy in sharing these burdens.</div>\n<div dir=\"auto\"> </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"x14z9mp xat24cr x1lziwak x1vvkbs xtlvy1s x126k92a\">\n<div dir=\"auto\">Each day revealed more about my parents' daily sacrifices, showing the depth of their commitment and love. Those days deepened my respect and love for them. I understood just how much they did for us. Every drop of sweat, every decision, every sacrifice was clear, maybe I still can't comprehend everything.</div>\n<div dir=\"auto\"> </div>\n<div dir=\"auto\">The sweet moments felt sweeter, and the hard times seemed easier. They could no longer trick me with claims like - they enjoyed grinding in the sun, or they disliked our favorite sabji so we siblings could eat more, or they preferred hard food so we could enjoy the tender parts. </div>\n<div dir=\"auto\"> </div>\n<div dir=\"auto\">Note: Converted from my phone notes.

If you could pick only songs you like, and play them on loop. If you could select people, select moments, and put them on a playlist, and if you could replay some of them. </p>\n<p>I don't feel like writing more. I have pretty much said everything I wanted to say above, and I will add just a few more lines. Indeed, life is like a playlist - you can almost always choose people you want to be friends with, people you want to work with, and you can even tune people at times to what you want them in your playlist to be. Okay, life is more like a free Spotify account. You get to build a playlist, but you have to try songs, artists, and in the process, sometimes it is fine to not like some. Put the best in your playlist. Doesn't mean the song is bad. Someone put their soul into it. Some billion people listened to it. Somehow, after a week, you are in a different mode, and suddenly you like the song. Life changes right!</p>\n<p>Life changes, so do our choices. They change themselves, and they change others too. I said free Spotify, do you recall? Free Spotify comes with unavoidable ads, the sorrows of life. You don't like it, but you can't skip. Hold yourself together, it will pass. It always passes. </p>\n<p>Try more, add more songs, or just play the recommended one. If you feel adventurous, try a new genre. Do it your way; it is your playlist. Remember one thing, the joy of having a playlist is in playing it, listening to it. </p>\n<p>Enjoy your playlist, I am enjoying the one shared with me. It is playing. 🎼</p>\n<p> </p>",

Hence, I won't ever pull out the awkwardness trick. Awkwardness in these situations is real. But think deeply, and awkwardness is nothing but an illusion for underconfidence or a conversation not having a green ego. </p>\n<p data-start=\"2534\" data-end=\"2734\"><strong data-start=\"2534\" data-end=\"2572\">Yes, each conversation should have an ego</strong><br data-start=\"2572\" data-end=\"2575\">A healthy, <span style=\"color: #2dc26b;\"><strong data-start=\"2586\" data-end=\"2599\">Green Ego</strong></span> in a conversation means it sustains itself.<br data-start=\"2643\" data-end=\"2646\">People feel its value, the importance.

Saw the legendary Great Banyan Tree, a living marvel that’s been around for more than 250 years. 250 years in a human lifetime is 6 generations at least. Nature always finds a way to humble me. Trust me, this story isn't about humility. </p>\n<p data-start=\"542\" data-end=\"861\">The original trunk of the Great Banyan was removed long ago. Yet, the tree still stands, spreading over acres, with its aerial roots dropping down, taking hold. If you didn’t know, you’d assume it’s a forest. Me being me, my overthinking brain found a metaphor for life, not just in a biological sense, but in the way existence connects us through generations.</p>\n<p data-start=\"997\" data-end=\"1338\">Each of those roots felt like a child, a grandchild, a descendant carrying forward the life of the original. Every new branch, every fresh root that touched the earth and turned into a trunk, was like a new life, and yet, it was still the same tree. The main trunk may be gone, but its spirit, its essence, continues through its extensions.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1340\" data-end=\"1753\">It made me think about how we humans and perhaps all living things have the same kind of legacy. You can choose how far back you want to go before you call something new, or still part of the old. Some people see life as a single event: a frame between birth and death. Others, maybe just me, are starting to sense it as a continuous thread, a series of connected moments, lives, and dreams that echo through time.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1755\" data-end=\"2095\">No matter how different I feel from my parents, no matter how much my choices, thoughts, or circumstances might diverge from theirs, I realize I’m still living a continuation of their dreams. And they were, in turn, carrying forward the hopes of their parents. That invisible connector persists. You can feel it if you look closely enough.</p>\n<p data-start=\"2097\" data-end=\"2478\">Even though I have no record or knowledge of what my ancestors dreamed a thousand years ago, some part of those aspirations, fears, instincts, and strengths have surely passed down through time, embedded in stories, choices, and even in silence. Maybe the ‘main trunk’ isn’t a person, or a single event, but this vast, unseen, breathing Tree of Life itself - alive in us, through us.</p>",

Didn't even feel a pinch in slow runs. It still hurt when I went full-blown sprinting. Bad news - didn't do much activity last week. I am home this week. The schedule will be back. </p>\n<p>Did an all-nighter on Monday as I was feeling a little rusty. Still, this week will be a mix of work, hustle &amp; social events - have a few weddings to attend. </p>\n<p>We had company on-site, and met everyone in India. I met the spaces team. Pretty cool to see everyone in person. </p>\n<p>I pulled the Google Analytics today, so good to see Kidli getting organic signups. I am sitting at 8. Not much, but yes. Should I build the thing?

This is the week I shall get them done. </p>\n<p>Update on last week, Did one good run. A couple of stretches. Okay, I won't count them as quality/intent wasn't there. Did some reading - Thinking in Bets and Consumption. Got good sleep.</p>\n<p>Cricket season has winded up. I also felt like taking a rest last week. Still got pulled into 2 matches.

            "content_html": "<p>It was 2011. Mom used to do her evening Puja, and I used to sit on a chair outside, soaking it, kind of passive-meditating, those sessions used to last 20 to 45 minutes. Most of that time was spent thinking, daydreaming, and chanting. I was an introvert; I always had a vivid imagination and could create a scene and play in my head during the sessions. During these times, the things pondered were - <em><strong>How can someone work every day? Without play? How hard must it be to be an adult?</strong></em></p>\n<p>I still can't understand how people work without play or fun. They must have fun in their own way. But after working full-time for the last six years, I have started working every day. I didn't touch my laptop from the 21st to the 30th of December, and this is the longest streak without work in my career. I will be out of the office until the 6th of January 2025. This is a good reset before the new year, but I am not used to it. And I couldn't stop myself from pulling out my laptop today. </p>\n<p>Year-end is a good time to reflect and plan for the coming year. Some people argue it is just another cycle of the sun, yes, it is. But every new round is an opportunity to let go of burdens &amp; start afresh. <em><strong>Every new cycle is the beginning of New Hope</strong></em>. May it be entirely new, or may it be compounding. I have been talking about my life working in cycles. And funnily, a very hard-working, thoughtful, and relatively successful friend mentioned another angle of looking at the cycles. Three years is the optimal time I have found to be working on one cycle, for me. This is a number that makes more sense looking back. </p>\n<p>The end of each cycle is a new beginning. I am wrapping up the last cycle and sitting on the horizon for the next to begin. My birthday falls in Feb, but I keep a count of December, It is a great time for a new start. Gives me a head start of 2 months. 2024 has been a kind year. <strong>For the few of you who know, </strong>2016 to 2019 was finding my feet, 2019 to 2021 was redemption. 2022 was a break year. I wanted to step back and break out of habits and schedules - although all were good habits. I put on 14 extra kgs. I Lost them in 2023 in the first 2 months. 2023 and 2024 were supposed to be the prep year. And so they were. So,<strong> where am I now? Where do I want to head?</strong></p>\n<p>Let me answer my approach to living first. This would flow into where I am. And where I want to head. In one of the interviews - either Gayle or Darren Sammy said - We west Indians live like there is no tomorrow. It was surely a decade ago. It was in my mind, but it got into my way of living only a few years ago. I lost one uncle in the village, who was very supportive of us in our hard times. I was sad for a bit. I am very realistic about life. I tried to understand the emotion, and it turned out - I was sad because I wanted to say how grateful I was to him and how much he meant to me. Life gave me a chance when He was alive; I didn't take it. I never thought I had limited time, yet we all have limited time. <strong>Rule no 1: Think there is no tomorrow - while treating people. Rule no 2: Death is eventual; be prepared for it, The way to be prepared is to have no regrets and have pride in myself.</strong> I stole it from a Hindi movie called - Roudi Rathor. Action-Drama, if you have a hell of free time, then Bollywood can kill time. </p>\n<p>Rule 2 to live is a bit meta, let's break it down. What does it mean to have no regrets? What does it mean to have pride? Oh, you might be looking for where I stand in life. This paragraph should answer it. Back to regrets and pride. We all mess things up. And regret not taking an alternative. But can we not take an alternative after X days? Let's say - I had an ugly fight with a hostel mate, and one part of my brain says the fight wasn't required, and my ego says I stood up for myself. When my ego settles down in two days, it might be too late to settle things up. This is where I would regret not settling it earlier. But not with rule 1. I wouldn't pick up the fight in the first place, and if even 1% of my brain says that wasn't required, I would go settle it up. Even after 10 days later. <strong>Regret is a missed opportunity</strong>. And when it comes to people, you always have an undo button unless time runs out. And it does run out very fast. But how do you not have regrets for, let's say, not scoring enough in 12th? Well, I can't do anything about it now, you can theoretically solve a math problem by proving it is unsolvable. Similarly, if I can't solve a situation in life, it is the reality. I have to accept and make the changes today with all the learnings. What about pride, then? Well, <strong>pride is pretty much a feeling of excellence</strong>. An honest answer to \"Did I give it my all\"? I am not too fused about Did I get it all? With all the resources I had, did I do justice? <strong>\"With a relatively good brain and a good mind, did I create the impact in the world in my capabilities, or did I try my best to create it\"? </strong><em>This is the question for me. </em></p>\n<p>I have broken down the Rule 2 in the above paragraph. As you might have noticed, both Rules 1 and 2, and almost all my conversations are around people &amp; impact. And this is what I want to do. This is what I have been trying to do. Have an impact on people's lives. Wherever I live, wherever I go, whoever I cross paths with. In return for my selfish pride and preparing for eternal truth. I can tell you I have been doing decently good at it. I have been able to touch &amp; inspire a few souls. Have tried a bunch of things in pursuit. It is a lifelong project, after all. This is where I stand. You got the answer finally. 🕺</p>\n<p>It must be 3 minutes already. It is going to be a long read. And I am intentionally keeping it more abstract in the beginning. I don't want people to read actual stuff. I want them to drop off before they read the actual stuff. I am an introvert, as I said already. Even if you read, I don't want to answer anything concrete in follow-ups. I am always on for going abstract and more philosophical conversations. </p>\n<p>Another filler line after a filler paragraph. I am 28, and in my mind, I am jumping into my 30s. Just 2 years in my 20s, so I should start preparing. I am betting on my good habits to be equally productive at 60. What's the point of physical, mental &amp; nutritional attention, what's the point of living remotely in a village, never touching alcohol, even no caffeine if not. This means I have optimistically 30 years of having peak impact. These are pointless numbers why am I bringing them up? I wanted to start up a few months ago. I explored a few ideas and domains. The answer to what I wanted to do - has always been to have an impact on first-degree people's lives. But startups are a wealth creation tool, not necessarily first-degree people's impact. Then why not NGOs? I wanted to start-up to create wealth. Wealth enables impact; It can enable NGOs, can't it? If 20's was the knowledge accumulation time, 30's is the wealth and leverage creation phase. My bet is to compound all of it in the '40s and have a massive impact in the 50s and '60s and compound just on impact &amp; leave it here in the latter half of life. </p>\n<p>This is the horizon I am looking at, from knowledge to wealth creation/accumulation. Knowledge accumulation should be passive and continuous. We learn to stand, and then we learn to walk. Standing becomes passive even when we continue learning sprints, long jumps. That's how compounding works. The horizon I am looking at requires taking bets, thinking bets, and winning bets. It is a game of delicate thinking &amp; execution - smart work some people say. I am bad at giving references, but I want to get better in 2025. It is also a game of luck. But <strong>luck, as I define it, isn't such a miracle. </strong></p>\n<p>If you are still here, I wish you a very good new year. I know we all are in a fight. Each new cycle will make you more powerful and wiser to keep fighting, and till you keep fighting, it is your game. <strong>Luck will come your way, and you will bend it to your will, as I said, Luck isn't such a miracle. </strong></p>",

And if you read this, don't tell anyone because it is <strong>secret</strong>. And don't even ask me!</p>\n<p>The confession: I have lost my bio-sleep clock. From 2016-2019, magically, I developed this ability to sleep an exact number of hours. Wake up without an alarm. I could sleep and wake up just on time. Every day for the next few years. It sounds weird, but It is true. For the last few months, I have been fighting hard to wake up to my alarm and yet have been missing it so many times! And it has been a quest to get my powers back. </p>\n<p>It feels magical when you have the perfect start to the day. And waking up on time, without an alarm, is part of the perfect start. It gives a really big boost to my day. These small things keep me fresh and more active than any coffee machine. </p>\n<p>As I reflect and write this, I can pinpoint one instance where I nearly missed my flight, and maybe that was the start of losing confidence. Subconscious operating prompts got messed up. Time to rewire. </p>\n<p>Time to set off the alarm to freshen my powers. Time for those timed naps. Time for a perfect start to the day. As I have been always used. </p>\n<p>Time for the perfect sleep now 😴</p>\n<p><strong>October 27th 2024</strong></p>\n<p>I tried removing the alarm and also tried putting a stricter instruction to my brain - that I must wake up at 5.30 am. I am almost there now. Energy is back. The Undertaker needs to raise (I will write on this later)!</p>\n<p><strong>Sat Nov 9th 2024</strong></p>\n<p>I am back on track. I have travelled to us, and my sense of timezone is till getting blended into my biological clock. But I don't need alarms anymore. It is a good feeling. I sleep extra on Staturday mornings, I pull all nighters once in a month on Staturday. All it took was a few concious weeks. I will provide one more update once I am back in bangalore. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>December 30 2024</p>\n<p>I am at home, and I don't need alarms. This is normal. </p>\n<p> </p>",

First day! ✅</li>\n<li>Caught cold somehow 🥶</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Day 3 - Wednesday, October 23rd 2024</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cold got worse. Wasn't at 100%, to be honest. </li>\n<li>Initially, I thought I would take a complete break, could only sleep so many hours. Later did some experiments at work.</li>\n<li>Yes, Went to the gym. ✅ I picked myself up. I could have had a better day. These cold and all shouldn't stop me. Show up! to Everything, Everywhere committed!</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Mid-week thoughts </strong></p>\n<p>There have been a few observations and thoughts that have slowed things down. But it shouldn't really—time to re-center the focus. I need to release a v0 this week. Even if it means just an LLM wrapper. </p>\n<p>Also, and it is an old realization, My day outside of work is heavily proportionate to my day at work. I should find ways to do the best work at any cost. Or start decoupling these two for the better. </p>\n<p>Looking forward to the next 3 days! And a game on Sunday 🏏</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 - Thursday, October 24th 2024</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rested from gym.  I will share my complete schedule for accountability. I shall update my calendar. And sell myself to the calendar. </li>\n<li>Had a good day at work - solved a few issues, helped fix one critical issue, and ran one good experiment. I am thinking of writing one article tomorrow on at least one experiment I ran in the week. ✅</li>\n<li>My Google Play console account verification was out of date. Updated - it took some time. Hope verification completes soon. 🟡 I would have liked to have at least the auth part solved today, but I couldn't do it. Let's do it tomorrow. I want to see a big check tomorrow. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Day 5 - Friday, October 25th 2024</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not much progress on Kidli</li>\n<li>Work wise a good day. Great demo by the team ✅</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Day 6 - Saturday, October 26th 2024</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Talked to an Edtech expert, with deep expertise in building learning experiences. Provided some references to people working in the space in India.</li>\n<li>Also found Thecuriousparent, thanks to an old friend, Seems like the guy is fighting the exact problem. Would be interesting to talk to. Let's see if I can set up a chat.</li>\n<li>Went deeper reading into b2b sales. Good all-nighter. Slept around 4, back at 8 with full energy. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Day 7 - Sunday, October 27th 2024</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Soft launched Kidli - Updated website, added Google Analytics, added waitlist form &amp; sent to parent groups, and Reddit. I must figure out if I can publicly put it on my socials. Socials reminded me, that I should add social links to the homepage. ✅</li>\n<li> Got one signup. It always starts like 0, 1, ... 🥳</li>\n<li>Had planned to go for a run, but missed. </li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Overall, it was a productive week. Got some work done, plus good food &amp; physical activity. I am writing this at 7.15 pm IST. Had a long screen time today, and I will be reading some books now. </p>\n<p>It is only going to get better from here. 💪</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>I am flying to Bangalore. I have been doing it three or four times a year. What is new? Only this time, I don't know when I am returning home. </p>\n<p>I am thinking of starting up. In fact, I have been thinking of starting up for more than a decade now. My good old roommates would know that I was always interested in making an impact and building a business. I did a few business stints while I was in college. 2016 to this day, has been a build-up to making a great one. I hope so 🤞.</p>\n<p>And I feel this is the time. The next step from here - having a crack at building a billion dollar Company. Every calculation I have been running leaves me with only one possible path at this junction of life. Startup!</p>\n<p>I have been blessed to be in tech. If I crack a good product and have revenue streams, it is easier to build a venture-backed business in this space, and scale really fast. And what better place than Bangalore? I can't afford SF 😅.</p>\n<p>I have some money in the bank to pay myself a minimum salary (monthly expenses) and some for operating costs and emergencies. I have unlimited energy. You can be on 5 coffees and 3 red-bulls, and I will still beat you in the second continuous marathon, just on water. I have convinced my parents not to rush me into marriage (typical Nepali/Gorkhali parents). I have all the time on that front as well. The point is, this is the time.  </p>\n<p>I am flying to Bangalore this Sunday, October 20, 2024, to explore the next phase. I don't know where it will lead me, but I know where I want it to lead me. I don't know if I will be broke by next year, but I know I will be more than fine.  </p>\n<p>I have a fascination with hardship and challenges. I am romanticizing it already. It is a Himalayan peak climb, Mount Everest. But imagine the peak being unique to the climber &amp; the climber doesn't get Sherpas.</p>\n<p>I love the journey, or rather, I love myself enough to endure any journey; I love the peak. And the peak is the true love. </p>\n<p>Love makes it worthwhile.</p>",
