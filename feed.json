No, it isn't a typo for Crash, which I also had a few years ago. The front bonnet of the car I was driving was destroyed. Thankfully, I wasn't even hurt. Changed me to realise small joys even more &amp; drive more carefully. Well, that's a different story. A blissful evening all by myself is better spent structuring my Crush story. </p>\n<h3>My heart dropped a beat</h3>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/media/posts/33/Screenshot-2025-07-20-at-12.29.39-AM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"527\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/media/posts/33/responsive/Screenshot-2025-07-20-at-12.29.39-AM-xs.png 640w ,https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/media/posts/33/responsive/Screenshot-2025-07-20-at-12.29.39-AM-sm.png 768w ,https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/media/posts/33/responsive/Screenshot-2025-07-20-at-12.29.39-AM-md.png 1024w ,https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/media/posts/33/responsive/Screenshot-2025-07-20-at-12.29.39-AM-lg.png 1366w ,https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/media/posts/33/responsive/Screenshot-2025-07-20-at-12.29.39-AM-xl.png 1600w ,https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/media/posts/33/responsive/Screenshot-2025-07-20-at-12.29.39-AM-2xl.png 1920w\">     </figure>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I was at a wedding, sitting beside a beautiful lady, married. She asked me -</p>\n<p>She - When are you getting married?</p>\n<p>Me - I don't know</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">She - Why?</span></p>\n<p>Me - Because I haven't found anyone compatible.</p>\n<p>I didn't want to make it a long answer. I didn't want to tell her a lot, explain what I was thinking. We weren't that connected. We were in a wedding venue, and had to scream every time to be audible. I thought we could move on from the conversation with this answer. She asked</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">She - How? Why did you not set someone up?</span></p>\n<p>She giggled and went on to mention how everyone is doing love marriage, and not seeing someone is a bad idea. </p>\n<p>Oh, boy, for a second my heart dropped a beat. For a second, I wanted to tell her - <strong>because I HAD A CRUSH ON YOU. It was a long time back, but it was special</strong>.</p>\n<p>It would have been a scene. I don't mind paying for such a scene. You know the saying, Thoughts travel faster than light. It did, and it did ruin the scene. I didn't tell her anything. I laughed, agreed, and moved on. In an alternate universe, I would have screamed for sure. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>How beautiful she is <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">(was)</span></h3>\n<p>She was really beautiful. And beauty is all in the eyes; it depends on who is looking and what they are looking at. I am not gonna give specifics for you people to figure this out. And if you feel like the girl, no, you weren't. Even when we had the above conversation. I had similar conversations with a lot of you in a very similar setup. What else do we have in common to talk otherwise? Maybe that was you. Keep reading. </p>\n<p>I had a crush on her. She was really beautiful. She had beautiful eyes. She was caring and full of optimism. She was so perfect. Felt my heart was beating for her - <a href=\"https://youtu.be/iasxMdSu7Jo?si=7h__RoE6Yog1wHig\">jiya dhadak, dhadak jaye (Youtube link)</a>. This was the song I had shared with my friend. </p>\n<p>The crush lasted for maybe 2/3 months. I never told her. I am the opposite of an impulse doer. In people I used to observe and observe. For things I used to procrastinate, this is my trick to stay under my budget. I was observing her - she gave me hope every day. She. gave me optimism every day. We didn't talk about these things - ever. But she did give me all the energy I needed at that time. Optimism is all I needed at that time. </p>\n<p>After 2/3 months, the crush faded away. Seeing her again never gave me the same blush. I used to have high expectations from people - on parameters like honesty, keeping a lot of self-pride, being specific and conscious about ownself. She wasn't there in many of those parameters, I realised. I still felt special, I still felt in love, but a picture of her faded in my heart.</p>\n<p>She taught me love, well, she doesn't know she taught me. She taught me the purest form of love. I used to walk on the field (Barikhar Khetir Ali) in monsoon rain, to help father in farming, I used to write songs, and I started writing poems. A heavy rain still takes me back to that feeling. I wasn't in love with her anymore; <strong>I started loving the feeling of love </strong>instead. I used to go for a run, and I thought someone was watching. This used to make me feel special; it still does. I used to write thinking someone was reading, and I still do. I am still blushing. Optimism that feeling gave me, I felt special, every time I fell, that feeling was there to pick me up.</p>\n<p>I have never described this. I don't know how to describe. I feel I can write a poem, and that will explain this better. That feeling made me cheer the monsoon rain, clear blue sky, and clouds; that feeling helped me be where I am. I am not an artist, not a school-trained traditional one, but still, that feeling made me one. Or so I like to believe. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>The gift of love</h3>\n<p>As I said, her picture has faded, and I don't even remember well how she looked back then. I tried one day remembering her very hard in the middle of a reflection time, plus rain. No, I couldn't remember her face. But this feeling is eternal. This feeling of love, of being special - this is going to last with me forever. This gives me optimism, as it was a big part of the hopes I had. It is a big part of the peace I have. It is so pure, I look at parents and find the same kind of love. It is all about giving and not expecting anything in return. But it gives so much back. I have seen fathers giving up their drinking habit, and I have seen mothers becoming stronger, more resilient, confident, and independent. Love without expectations, without anything in return, does return so much more than people with expectations can ever imagine. </p>\n<p>Leaving you here with a movie that reflects a similar journey. It is a good watch and completes what I am saying here. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FE0ZLvfITSc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nanhe Jaisalmer - Youtube link</a><br><br></p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight \">Note: I didn't add details about her, no specific timelines, no specific places. I know a few people with a lot of time interested in figuring this out. I can't leave clues here. But if we had the above conversation, you would know it was you. You had a big impact, without realizing it. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

First, I needed to get a jar of water to my dad, who was working under the scorching sun on an MGNREGA project, just 800 meters from our house. I raced over, handed him the jar, and was about to head back when he asked me to fill in for him for just 15 minutes while he fed the cows.</div>\n<div dir=\"auto\"> </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"x14z9mp xat24cr x1lziwak x1vvkbs xtlvy1s x126k92a\">\n<div dir=\"auto\">I agreed, although I managed to negotiate it down from the 30 minutes he originally asked for. There I was, shovel in hand, helping to dig a pool. I was annoyed at missing out on time with my friends. Minutes turned into hours, stretching unexpectedly until 4 PM. We were done for the day.</div>\n<div dir=\"auto\"> </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"x14z9mp xat24cr x1lziwak x1vvkbs xtlvy1s x126k92a\">\n<div dir=\"auto\">Walking home, I was furious. I felt tricked and disappointed. I couldn’t even look at my dad when I saw him still working on our farm. In a burst of anger, I threw the water jar aside and vented all my frustrations. That night was restless, filled with rage and tears.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"x14z9mp xat24cr x1lziwak x1vvkbs xtlvy1s x126k92a\">\n<div dir=\"auto\">The next morning, with my anger slightly gone, I decided to go back to work. Maybe part of me wanted to make him feel guilty.</div>\n<div dir=\"auto\"> </div>\n<div dir=\"auto\">I worked the entire day and realized just how much my father did for us. Even the previous day, while I was at the pool, he was still working on the farm. The work at the pool was relatively easier, and there were many others like him, working hard for their families, some only a few years older than me. I realized it was an opportunity to help the hardest-working person I knew. I could still play after 4 PM. I returned home that day and decided to continue working with a smile. For the next 20 days, I worked not out of obligation, but out of deep respect and joy in sharing these burdens.</div>\n<div dir=\"auto\"> </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"x14z9mp xat24cr x1lziwak x1vvkbs xtlvy1s x126k92a\">\n<div dir=\"auto\">Each day revealed more about my parents' daily sacrifices, showing the depth of their commitment and love. Those days deepened my respect and love for them. I understood just how much they did for us. Every drop of sweat, every decision, every sacrifice was clear, maybe I still can't comprehend everything.</div>\n<div dir=\"auto\"> </div>\n<div dir=\"auto\">The sweet moments felt sweeter, and the hard times seemed easier. They could no longer trick me with claims like - they enjoyed grinding in the sun, or they disliked our favorite sabji so we siblings could eat more, or they preferred hard food so we could enjoy the tender parts. </div>\n<div dir=\"auto\"> </div>\n<div dir=\"auto\">Note: Converted from my phone notes.

I have pretty much said everything I wanted to say above, and I will add just a few more lines. Indeed, life is like a playlist - you can almost always choose people you want to be friends with, people you want to work with, and you can even tune people at times to what you want them in your playlist to be. Okay, life is more like a free Spotify account. You get to build a playlist, but you have to try songs, artists, and in the process, sometimes it is fine to not like some. Put the best in your playlist. Doesn't mean the song is bad. Someone put their soul into it. Some billion people listened to it. Somehow, after a week, you are in a different mode, and suddenly you like the song. Life changes right!</p>\n<p>Life changes, so do our choices. They change themselves, and they change others too. I said free Spotify, do you recall? Free Spotify comes with unavoidable ads, the sorrows of life. You don't like it, but you can't skip. Hold yourself together, it will pass. It always passes. </p>\n<p>Try more, add more songs, or just play the recommended one. If you feel adventurous, try a new genre. Do it your way; it is your playlist. Remember one thing, the joy of having a playlist is in playing it, listening to it. </p>\n<p>Enjoy your playlist, I am enjoying the one shared with me. It is playing. 🎼</p>\n<p> </p>",

You can choose how far back you want to go before you call something new, or still part of the old. Some people see life as a single event: a frame between birth and death. Others, maybe just me, are starting to sense it as a continuous thread, a series of connected moments, lives, and dreams that echo through time.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1755\" data-end=\"2095\">No matter how different I feel from my parents, no matter how much my choices, thoughts, or circumstances might diverge from theirs, I realize I’m still living a continuation of their dreams. And they were, in turn, carrying forward the hopes of their parents. That invisible connector persists. You can feel it if you look closely enough.</p>\n<p data-start=\"2097\" data-end=\"2478\">Even though I have no record or knowledge of what my ancestors dreamed a thousand years ago, some part of those aspirations, fears, instincts, and strengths have surely passed down through time, embedded in stories, choices, and even in silence. Maybe the ‘main trunk’ isn’t a person, or a single event, but this vast, unseen, breathing Tree of Life itself - alive in us, through us.</p>",

Had a great last weekend. Felt like a complete reset, and felt like a long long weekend. Let's have another great week. ✌</p>\n<p>Update July 19th, Saturday 12.05AM 😄</p>\n<p>I had my laptop on my side for sometime to write this. Got late. This was good week. At work didn't even realise how fast it flew. Went to attend an event on Monday. Father wasn't feeling well, took him to hospital on Tuesday. And I was kind of covering up for the week. That's the reason IG. But week itself was very productive. Have setup a sync going with a very senior dev on org impact. In my team - it is time for me to step up for the scaling our systems, today was mostly that. </p>\n<p>Personally, Have been consistent with runs. Did a 7K 🎉. Oh, I am still good, I am the best. Let's go to specifics</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Health ✅ - feeling good. Had a few good runs. Can be part of some more family chores. Gona get them done in the weekends.</li>\n<li>Knowledge ✅ - Learnt a few sentences of Sanskrit. Gonna complete 100th page this weekend. That WILL BE 25%. </li>\n<li>Wealth 🚫 - Haven't done anything. The 5% I made last week, went upto 22%. Should have exited. Got greedy or better lazy. I do this. I must sale within a week &amp; rebalance. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Should do more tech exploration this weekend. And some more family time. Will update by Sunday. </p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1ivhe1f6d3q\">July 7th, Week 28th</h2>\n<p>Almost feels like a repetition. Doesn't it?</p>\n<p>What's the value of progress if it isn't directional? What's the value of speed if it is an oscillation?</p>\n<p>I am part of Sikhsya Kalyan Nyash, which aims to elevate the educational environment in the area, but most I have seen is facilitation. But it is understandable, as most people don't have time, so they would rather give out money. Yesterday received the 3rd-yearly book they published. I had been contemplating whether to continue with it, the membership. Maybe it isn't much financially. But, you know, it isn't easy for me to just not be involved. Guess I will have to learn. </p>\n<p>I would like to bring color coding back again</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Health - Played a few games ✅, in a very healthy mind state.\n<ul>\n<li>I did take a few personal stances last week. I did put a status - It happens some fights I can't lose, even though I don't want to fight. So better to fight and fight for the glory. <a href=\"https://x.com/thebstar13/status/1939676038235365505\">Read the tweet</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Wealth - Haven't done anything here 🛑</li>\n<li>Knowledge - Just random reads, I gotta do better. Also, it is July, so, I should focus on learning a language. I don't want to come back and say I didn't learn a new language. 🛑</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Update July 11 🕺</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I feel I am back here. My schedule is patched back. One of the reasons I want to fly to Bangalore in July to meet new folks &amp; Div, but don't want to fly to not messing up my schedule. Gotta continue it for some time without any disruption.</li>\n<li>With a few runs, games this week, health goals are checked ✅. Sleep is perfect.</li>\n<li>On wealth: Haven't made any money but have surely taken a few bets this week. This is new for the year. It is happening. ⚡</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>July 12</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>This week was a solid ✅</li>\n<li>I did some building -&gt; <a href=\"https://x.com/thebstar13/status/1944012117591695640\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Built an AI browser prototype</a></li>\n<li>Have done a few good runs with my brother</li>\n<li>Have been back at learning Sanskrit\n<ul>\n<li>I have a 400-page book, down to the 86th page. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>I tried some bets on the wealth side, got a 5% return in a week. Mainly, it was a bullish week. </li>\n<li>And I have one more day, this feels like me. Let me add a dance emoji 🕺</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Running fixes me everytime</strong>. And writting, Plus conversations with same brain wave people. </p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1iv3dil5414\">July 1st, Week 27th</h2>\n<p>Well, it's been a long, long time. 10 weeks 🤡</p>\n<p>Honestly, have done nothing from this list. </p>\n<p>- Have played a handful of cricket. Visited Kolkata. </p>\n<p>I was regular at the fitness for some time, but went to Bangalore last week and continuity was broken. Need to get back this week. </p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1ipg9p4jh4a\">April 23rd, Week 17th</h2>\n<p>Was in Bangalore last week, week 16th. Back home now. The good news is knee felt really good last week. Didn't even feel a pinch in slow runs. It still hurt when I went full-blown sprinting. Bad news - didn't do much activity last week. I am home this week. The schedule will be back. </p>\n<p>Did an all-nighter on Monday as I was feeling a little rusty. Still, this week will be a mix of work, hustle &amp; social events - have a few weddings to attend. </p>\n<p>We had company on-site, and met everyone in India. I met the spaces team. Pretty cool to see everyone in person. </p>\n<p>I pulled the Google Analytics today, so good to see Kidli getting organic signups. I am sitting at 8. Not much, but yes. Should I build the thing? Considering I have MSFT credits and just put it online. Maybe I should. </p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"color: #2dc26b;\">1 run exactly, a few pushups</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #169179;\">Did some reading - Leading effective engineering</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #f1c40f;\">Met friends, work friends. </span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">Didn't do any building on side. </span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #2dc26b;\">I have setup 1:1 with a very senior engg in LD. I should do this with more folks and learn from them.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1ipg9p4jh4b\">April 10th, Week 15th</h2>\n<p>Have been holding up well in terms of fitness. Waking up early, sleeping probably less than ideal. But exercising well. Knees are starting to feel a little better. </p>\n<p>Haven't read anything this week so far. Haven't published anything so far. BAU in work life. </p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1inmm5m8i4t\">March 31st, Week 14th</h2>\n<p>I have a few (two or three) sit-downs in front of computer tasks, each lasting 15-30 minutes, but I have procrastinated. This is the week I shall get them done. </p>\n<p>Update on last week, Did one good run. A couple of stretches. Okay, I won't count them as quality/intent wasn't there. Did some reading - Thinking in Bets and Consumption. Got good sleep.</p>\n<p>Cricket season has winded up. I also felt like taking a rest last week. Still got pulled into 2 matches. Wasted my time wildly last week. I binge-watched Marvel Punisher. Woke up way out of schedule on Saturday &amp; Sunday. Full awake midnights give me energy. This week I plan to use them in a more like 'me'. 🤘</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"color: #169179;\">Get good 3 runs &amp; 7 days of full body stretch. </span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #ba372a;\">MCP, set up</span> &amp; <span style=\"color: #169179;\">play with them</span>. <span style=\"color: #ba372a;\">Post something by the end of the week.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #169179;\">Read. I have a new book on leading engineering teams that I haven't opened.</span> I have exactly two Assamese books I bought from a book fair 2 months back, I haven't opened them yet. Not sure if I will end up opening the Assamese book. Will take a hell lot of energy from me to do that. One isn't fiction so maybe I will open it. </li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #ba372a;\">By the weekend - close all housekeeping digital work pending on me. </span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Update here by the end of the week. </p>\n<p>Update: Week went well in terms of all 3 but the 4th item. I don't know if I will ever open those Assamese books.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1in9scsd8ei\">March 26th, Week 13th</h2>\n<p>Honestly, I don't remember which week this is (the 13th, I googled it). I haven't been able to tick anything from the above list. Although</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Health\n<ul>\n<li>I have been sleeping well. A good number of hours. ~8. I want to bring it down to 6/7. </li>\n<li>I have also started doing a few runs. Not regular yet.</li>\n<li>Physically, look-wise, I am not way far from abs. I have maintained where I got by the end of 2024. </li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #f1c40f;\">My diet can be better.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">I have developed lower back pain &amp; knee pain. Have been working on recovery. Getting better. It should go away in the next 2 weeks. </span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">Should hit the gym. </span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Learnings &amp; Build\n<ul>\n<li>I have been reading books - Recently reading Thinking in Bets.</li>\n<li>I have built a few new POCs, on the build side, all on my Git Hub - https://github.com/thebstar. </li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #e67e23;\">Still running behind on the latest AI stuff, practically. </span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Growth &amp; Investment\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #169179;\">I have started technical advising in a tech startup. <a href=\"https://spacesos.com/\" style=\"color: #169179;\">https://spacesos.com/</a></span></li>\n<li>I have set up some passive investments.

I am here finalizing the direction on the <strong>4th week, 20th of Jan</strong>. Hence, Can I say I created the clarity? Saying this, I did start re-reading the 11th Math book.

            "content_html": "<p>It was 2011. Mom used to do her evening Puja, and I used to sit on a chair outside, soaking it, kind of passive-meditating, those sessions used to last 20 to 45 minutes. Most of that time was spent thinking, daydreaming, and chanting. I was an introvert; I always had a vivid imagination and could create a scene and play in my head during the sessions. During these times, the things pondered were - <em><strong>How can someone work every day? Without play? How hard must it be to be an adult?</strong></em></p>\n<p>I still can't understand how people work without play or fun. They must have fun in their own way. But after working full-time for the last six years, I have started working every day. I didn't touch my laptop from the 21st to the 30th of December, and this is the longest streak without work in my career. I will be out of the office until the 6th of January 2025. This is a good reset before the new year, but I am not used to it. And I couldn't stop myself from pulling out my laptop today. </p>\n<p>Year-end is a good time to reflect and plan for the coming year. Some people argue it is just another cycle of the sun, yes, it is. But every new round is an opportunity to let go of burdens &amp; start afresh. <em><strong>Every new cycle is the beginning of New Hope</strong></em>. May it be entirely new, or may it be compounding. I have been talking about my life working in cycles. And funnily, a very hard-working, thoughtful, and relatively successful friend mentioned another angle of looking at the cycles. Three years is the optimal time I have found to be working on one cycle, for me. This is a number that makes more sense looking back. </p>\n<p>The end of each cycle is a new beginning. I am wrapping up the last cycle and sitting on the horizon for the next to begin. My birthday falls in Feb, but I keep a count of December, It is a great time for a new start. Gives me a head start of 2 months. 2024 has been a kind year. <strong>For the few of you who know, </strong>2016 to 2019 was finding my feet, 2019 to 2021 was redemption. 2022 was a break year. I wanted to step back and break out of habits and schedules - although all were good habits. I put on 14 extra kgs. I Lost them in 2023 in the first 2 months. 2023 and 2024 were supposed to be the prep year. And so they were. So,<strong> where am I now? Where do I want to head?</strong></p>\n<p>Let me answer my approach to living first. This would flow into where I am. And where I want to head. In one of the interviews - either Gayle or Darren Sammy said - We west Indians live like there is no tomorrow. It was surely a decade ago. It was in my mind, but it got into my way of living only a few years ago. I lost one uncle in the village, who was very supportive of us in our hard times. I was sad for a bit. I am very realistic about life. I tried to understand the emotion, and it turned out - I was sad because I wanted to say how grateful I was to him and how much he meant to me. Life gave me a chance when He was alive; I didn't take it. I never thought I had limited time, yet we all have limited time. <strong>Rule no 1: Think there is no tomorrow - while treating people. Rule no 2: Death is eventual; be prepared for it, The way to be prepared is to have no regrets and have pride in myself.</strong> I stole it from a Hindi movie called - Roudi Rathor. Action-Drama, if you have a hell of free time, then Bollywood can kill time. </p>\n<p>Rule 2 to live is a bit meta, let's break it down. What does it mean to have no regrets? What does it mean to have pride? Oh, you might be looking for where I stand in life. This paragraph should answer it. Back to regrets and pride. We all mess things up. And regret not taking an alternative. But can we not take an alternative after X days? Let's say - I had an ugly fight with a hostel mate, and one part of my brain says the fight wasn't required, and my ego says I stood up for myself. When my ego settles down in two days, it might be too late to settle things up. This is where I would regret not settling it earlier. But not with rule 1. I wouldn't pick up the fight in the first place, and if even 1% of my brain says that wasn't required, I would go settle it up. Even after 10 days later. <strong>Regret is a missed opportunity</strong>. And when it comes to people, you always have an undo button unless time runs out. And it does run out very fast. But how do you not have regrets for, let's say, not scoring enough in 12th? Well, I can't do anything about it now, you can theoretically solve a math problem by proving it is unsolvable. Similarly, if I can't solve a situation in life, it is the reality. I have to accept and make the changes today with all the learnings. What about pride, then? Well, <strong>pride is pretty much a feeling of excellence</strong>. An honest answer to \"Did I give it my all\"? I am not too fused about Did I get it all? With all the resources I had, did I do justice? <strong>\"With a relatively good brain and a good mind, did I create the impact in the world in my capabilities, or did I try my best to create it\"? </strong><em>This is the question for me. </em></p>\n<p>I have broken down the Rule 2 in the above paragraph. As you might have noticed, both Rules 1 and 2, and almost all my conversations are around people &amp; impact. And this is what I want to do. This is what I have been trying to do. Have an impact on people's lives. Wherever I live, wherever I go, whoever I cross paths with. In return for my selfish pride and preparing for eternal truth. I can tell you I have been doing decently good at it. I have been able to touch &amp; inspire a few souls. Have tried a bunch of things in pursuit. It is a lifelong project, after all. This is where I stand. You got the answer finally. 🕺</p>\n<p>It must be 3 minutes already. It is going to be a long read. And I am intentionally keeping it more abstract in the beginning. I don't want people to read actual stuff. I want them to drop off before they read the actual stuff. I am an introvert, as I said already. Even if you read, I don't want to answer anything concrete in follow-ups. I am always on for going abstract and more philosophical conversations. </p>\n<p>Another filler line after a filler paragraph. I am 28, and in my mind, I am jumping into my 30s. Just 2 years in my 20s, so I should start preparing. I am betting on my good habits to be equally productive at 60. What's the point of physical, mental &amp; nutritional attention, what's the point of living remotely in a village, never touching alcohol, even no caffeine if not. This means I have optimistically 30 years of having peak impact. These are pointless numbers why am I bringing them up? I wanted to start up a few months ago. I explored a few ideas and domains. The answer to what I wanted to do - has always been to have an impact on first-degree people's lives. But startups are a wealth creation tool, not necessarily first-degree people's impact. Then why not NGOs? I wanted to start-up to create wealth. Wealth enables impact; It can enable NGOs, can't it? If 20's was the knowledge accumulation time, 30's is the wealth and leverage creation phase. My bet is to compound all of it in the '40s and have a massive impact in the 50s and '60s and compound just on impact &amp; leave it here in the latter half of life. </p>\n<p>This is the horizon I am looking at, from knowledge to wealth creation/accumulation. Knowledge accumulation should be passive and continuous. We learn to stand, and then we learn to walk. Standing becomes passive even when we continue learning sprints, long jumps. That's how compounding works. The horizon I am looking at requires taking bets, thinking bets, and winning bets. It is a game of delicate thinking &amp; execution - smart work some people say. I am bad at giving references, but I want to get better in 2025. It is also a game of luck. But <strong>luck, as I define it, isn't such a miracle. </strong></p>\n<p>If you are still here, I wish you a very good new year. I know we all are in a fight. Each new cycle will make you more powerful and wiser to keep fighting, and till you keep fighting, it is your game. <strong>Luck will come your way, and you will bend it to your will, as I said, Luck isn't such a miracle. </strong></p>",

If I do it well, there will be Bangalore Diwali celebrations to end the week. I don't have much idea about the celebration, though. I will update this on Monday, 28th October 2024. </p>\n<p><strong>Nov 3rd, Sunday 2024, PST</strong></p>\n<p>I am in SF for the next two weeks for company work. Things have changed. I haven't made any progress on building the product or talking to people. I missed hitting the gym for the entire week.</p>\n<p>It was a short working week. In the latter half, I went for a few cricket games. I have been reading 'The Clear Thinking,' which is very much in line with Thinking, Fast &amp; Slow. </p>\n<p>It was a very messy week to summarize, or I can't summarize. Stay tuned for updates from SF. One of my friends suggested I should use more social media. Blogging isn't a great medium for uploading pictures. If I end up taking enough good pictures, I will think. </p>\n<p><strong>Nov 9th, Saturday 2024, PST</strong></p>\n<p>It has been a busy week. Early morning runs / walks, work, evening naps, Sightseeing IST standup, phone, laptop, sleep 🔁 repeat. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Week 3, 11th Nov to 17th 2024</strong></p>\n<p>---- Wish I had filled this up, But there was barely anything new here. ----</p>\n<p>Worked from room &amp; office a few days a week. Got back to proper building after some time. Played a hell lot of cricket. Played 4 matches in a weekend. I don't think I can beat that, neither I want to. </p>\n<p>Thats How the November went. And first 2nd week of December too. </p>\n<p> </p>",

I am not providing <a href=\"https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/week-1.html\">my daily update here, For that go read this</a>. Here, I am confessing, a secret confession. And if you read this, don't tell anyone because it is <strong>secret</strong>. And don't even ask me!</p>\n<p>The confession: I have lost my bio-sleep clock. From 2016-2019, magically, I developed this ability to sleep an exact number of hours. Wake up without an alarm. I could sleep and wake up just on time. Every day for the next few years. It sounds weird, but It is true. For the last few months, I have been fighting hard to wake up to my alarm and yet have been missing it so many times! And it has been a quest to get my powers back. </p>\n<p>It feels magical when you have the perfect start to the day. And waking up on time, without an alarm, is part of the perfect start. It gives a really big boost to my day. These small things keep me fresh and more active than any coffee machine. </p>\n<p>As I reflect and write this, I can pinpoint one instance where I nearly missed my flight, and maybe that was the start of losing confidence. Subconscious operating prompts got messed up. Time to rewire. </p>\n<p>Time to set off the alarm to freshen my powers. Time for those timed naps. Time for a perfect start to the day. As I have been always used. </p>\n<p>Time for the perfect sleep now 😴</p>\n<p><strong>October 27th 2024</strong></p>\n<p>I tried removing the alarm and also tried putting a stricter instruction to my brain - that I must wake up at 5.30 am. I am almost there now. Energy is back. The Undertaker needs to raise (I will write on this later)!</p>\n<p><strong>Sat Nov 9th 2024</strong></p>\n<p>I am back on track. I have travelled to us, and my sense of timezone is till getting blended into my biological clock. But I don't need alarms anymore. It is a good feeling. I sleep extra on Staturday mornings, I pull all nighters once in a month on Staturday. All it took was a few concious weeks. I will provide one more update once I am back in bangalore. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>December 30 2024</p>\n<p>I am at home, and I don't need alarms. This is normal. </p>\n<p> </p>",

I will call it a day for today. </p>\n<p><strong>Week 1 starts tomorrow 🎬</strong></p>\n<p>I will be in Bangalore at least till December end. I saw a year progression tweet - 80% is done. We have only 20% left of 2024. Time to buckle up. This is a live document for week 1. </p>\n<p>Before we start, I have a few goals - </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Setup the place ✅</li>\n<li>Hit the gym ✅</li>\n<li>Cricket practice 2 days a week 🔴</li>\n<li>Eat and sleep well - it is a long game. ✅</li>\n<li>Build the first version of Kidli - Web send to select parents. - Instead did a soft signup launch - got the first signup. 🟡 🥳</li>\n<li>Build the Kidli App (ios/android) - Do a release </li>\n<li>Get 100 paid parents</li>\n<li>Publish articles - Tech, Leadership, learnings - 2 articles a week. 🟡</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note: I might change some in November but until then let's run with these. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Day 0 - Sunday, October 20th 2024</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Received the rejection email from <a href=\"https://www.zfellows.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">ZFellows</a> - Without any traction &amp; a co-founder it was kind of obvious. But hey, It fast-tracked my pitch deck and solidified the space. Talked to a few potential users, which I was delaying otherwise. </li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Day 1 - Monday, October 21st 2024</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Setup wifi, room ✅, few things pending - take delivery of chair, a big bucket since the area seems to have some water issues, bedsheet &amp; a pillow</li>\n<li>Fixed gym - hitting from tomorrow. Found a cricket club - a scheduled match on Sunday. ✅</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">Should have Kidli API running today</span>. 🧑‍💻 Update: Only got basic Azure open ai llm wrapper setup. Didn't complete this. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Day 2 - Tuesday, October 22nd 2024</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Had a good day at work. Did some WebGPU experiments. ✅</li>\n<li>Didn't make much progress on the personal front. </li>\n<li>Okay, went to the gym. First day! ✅</li>\n<li>Caught cold somehow 🥶</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Day 3 - Wednesday, October 23rd 2024</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cold got worse. Wasn't at 100%, to be honest. </li>\n<li>Initially, I thought I would take a complete break, could only sleep so many hours. Later did some experiments at work.</li>\n<li>Yes, Went to the gym. ✅ I picked myself up. I could have had a better day. These cold and all shouldn't stop me. Show up! to Everything, Everywhere committed!</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Mid-week thoughts </strong></p>\n<p>There have been a few observations and thoughts that have slowed things down. But it shouldn't really—time to re-center the focus. I need to release a v0 this week. Even if it means just an LLM wrapper. </p>\n<p>Also, and it is an old realization, My day outside of work is heavily proportionate to my day at work. I should find ways to do the best work at any cost. Or start decoupling these two for the better. </p>\n<p>Looking forward to the next 3 days! And a game on Sunday 🏏</p>\n<p><strong>Day 4 - Thursday, October 24th 2024</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rested from gym.  I will share my complete schedule for accountability. I shall update my calendar. And sell myself to the calendar. </li>\n<li>Had a good day at work - solved a few issues, helped fix one critical issue, and ran one good experiment. I am thinking of writing one article tomorrow on at least one experiment I ran in the week. ✅</li>\n<li>My Google Play console account verification was out of date. Updated - it took some time. Hope verification completes soon. 🟡 I would have liked to have at least the auth part solved today, but I couldn't do it. Let's do it tomorrow. I want to see a big check tomorrow. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Day 5 - Friday, October 25th 2024</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not much progress on Kidli</li>\n<li>Work wise a good day. Great demo by the team ✅</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Day 6 - Saturday, October 26th 2024</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Talked to an Edtech expert, with deep expertise in building learning experiences. Provided some references to people working in the space in India.</li>\n<li>Also found Thecuriousparent, thanks to an old friend, Seems like the guy is fighting the exact problem. Would be interesting to talk to. Let's see if I can set up a chat.</li>\n<li>Went deeper reading into b2b sales. Good all-nighter. Slept around 4, back at 8 with full energy. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Day 7 - Sunday, October 27th 2024</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Soft launched Kidli - Updated website, added Google Analytics, added waitlist form &amp; sent to parent groups, and Reddit. I must figure out if I can publicly put it on my socials. Socials reminded me, that I should add social links to the homepage. ✅</li>\n<li> Got one signup. It always starts like 0, 1, ... 🥳</li>\n<li>Had planned to go for a run, but missed. </li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Overall, it was a productive week. Got some work done, plus good food &amp; physical activity. I am writing this at 7.15 pm IST. Had a long screen time today, and I will be reading some books now. </p>\n<p>It is only going to get better from here. 💪</p>",
