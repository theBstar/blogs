My good old roommates would know that I was always interested in making an impact and building a business. I did a few business stints while I was in college. 2016 to this day, has been a build-up to making a great one. I hope so ü§û.</p>\n<p>And I feel this is the time. The next step from here - having a crack at building a billion dollar Company. Every calculation I have been running leaves me with only one possible path at this junction of life. Startup!</p>\n<p>I have been blessed to be in tech. If I crack a good product and have revenue streams, it is easier to build a venture-backed business in this space, and scale really fast. And what better place than Bangalore? I can't afford SF üòÖ.</p>\n<p>I have some money in the bank to pay myself a minimum salary (monthly expenses) and some for operating costs and emergencies. I have unlimited energy. You can be on 5 coffees and 3 red-bulls, and I will still beat you in the second continuous marathon, just on water. I have convinced my parents not to rush me into marriage (typical Nepali/Gorkhali parents). I have all the time on that front as well. The point is, this is the time. ¬†</p>\n<p>I am flying to Bangalore this Sunday, October 20, 2024, to explore the next phase. I don't know where it will lead me, but I know where I want it to lead me. I don't know if I will be broke by next year, but I know I will be more than fine. ¬†</p>\n<p>I have a fascination with hardship and challenges. I am romanticizing it already. It is a Himalayan peak climb, Mount Everest. But imagine the peak being unique to the climber &amp; the climber doesn't get Sherpas.</p>\n<p>I love the journey, or rather, I love myself enough to endure any journey; I love the peak. And the peak is the true love.¬†</p>\n<p>Love makes it worthwhile.</p>",

Only things beyond 90 inches to certainty. 50/50 is when you aren't sure. 60/40 is still in the uncertainty zone, IMO. Even the 70, on the other hand, is clarity and conviction towards A. If I follow <a href=\"https://www.seedtoscale.com/blog/kunal-shahs-delta-4-theory-of-successful-startups\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Delta 4 framework by Kunal Shah</a>, Here the Delta is 4. It 70/30 clarity rule is even practiced by Amazon in decisions making if I recall correctly. But for critical decisions, where speed still matters, 80/20 is a one. It provides a balance of clarity and certainty. 70/30 for more speed.¬†</p>\n<p>The thought came to me while driving yesterday morning. For A/B with initial weights as x/y and it to be x'/y'.

You can negotiate for a B 4x better for it to win. And when you already have such a strong affinity towards A, sitting on the negotiation table doesn't harm. You come out with a 4x, or you have an A anyway. Who knows if you are even getting a 16x? It absolutely does not harm if you are comparing future optimistic value vs liquidity today.</p>\n<p>Go, use the formula. To make it more robust, you can update it with an inflation factor for money, risk &amp; opportunity cost for new opportunity cost, joy vs regret weightage for emotions, state of mind, etc.¬†</p>",

Whatever minimum, I saw of Tarun handling &amp; designing operation excellence. Rajendra Sir with the knowledge. I said I could go on.</p>\n<p>Let's come back to the point. He was replying to this clickbaity tweet. I know where it is coming from. The original twitter means to not fake your status game. Don't show off. I am not here to comment on it. 'Making it' is more important to me. How people handle it after making it is a personal choice. Whether you show off, or play it under the carpet - upto you. If you feel like 'making it' is a journey, we will talk about it later. For now we will stick to 'Faking it till making it', specifically Faking before making it.</p>\n<p>Let's break it down -¬†</p>\n<h4><strong>Making it</strong></h4>\n<p>To make it, you need a goal. You always have to start with a goal. One that you are fully committed to. A goal requires plans. Multiple plans, broken down by different milestones in the journey. Bridging the gap between today and the goal on each steps. You need to put a lot of things together to achieve this. And most important of these is putting your mental game in place.¬†</p>\n<h4>Faking it</h4>\n<p>Yes, faking it. To be a winner you need to start thinking like a winner, work like a winner. Think you are already making it, you are destined to make it. Now, back track honestly from here. Figure out what all are you destined to do. And live it. This is what faking it is.¬†</p>\n<p>¬†</p>\n<p>Let's take a simplified example,¬†</p>\n<p>Goal - Running a sub 20 5k.¬†</p>\n<p>Planning - I have 3 months to run sub 20min 5k. And my current PR is 24 min. I have a plan prepared by an expert coach on Nike run club. The expert coach has already applied back-tracking to prepare the plan.</p>\n<p>Executing the plan, is what it requires now. When I know execution is hard, this is where people give up. Faking can really help here. Everytime I go for a run, I am the sub 20 5k runner completing his traning. Everytime I feel low, I fake it to think how would I the future, who has already run a sub 20 min 5k would pick him up.¬†</p>\n<p>And this is how I weight my risk and opportunities as well.</p>\n<p>All of this is internal. Tricking mind to play the best, live the moment in head to prepare for reality, to bridge the gap. Elite atheletes do visualisations before games, they live the moment way before it actually happens to prepare their future self, by using their fake future self. Oh, are we in a time travel paradox? üòÖ</p>\n<p>Go, fake it <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">till</span> to make it.¬†</p>\n<p>Cheers.¬†</p>\n<p>¬†</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>I wanted to be a superman. Not exactly, I never had a TV growing up. My neighbourhood of 150 homes had only 2/3 TVs. I must have been 7/8 years old. My paternal uncle (edlest of my father's sibling), used to take me to one of those neighbours. It was so fun job to be flying around, to be able to help needy.</p>\n<p>My mother once told me, and also Sree Krishna in Mahabharat (can't recall correctly) 'Wish for others, and good things will happen'.¬† This made so sense to my tinny brain. I had only three wishes</p>\n<p>1. Give peace to everyone.</p>\n<p>2. Give them good thoughts.</p>\n<p>3. <em><strong>And make me Shaktiman.¬†</strong></em></p>\n<p>It continued till 2008+-1 years. I used to believe I had a deep connection with god. In 2008, I got hooked into watching cricket. And I found a new idol. Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar. So simple of a man, giving so many hopes, bringing joy. I used to find myself in him. My 2 wishes remained the same. 3rd was changed now. I provided god the option. <em><strong>Make me a Shaktiman or a Cricketer.¬†</strong></em></p>\n<p>It was 2011, I wrote my 10th exams. I had a proper break. I used to sit and meditate for almost half an hour every evening. Also, during this time mahabharat was being re-aired. The narator `Samay (Time)`, told how it is the only constant, only flowing truth in the form of change. It also narrated `How satya, and dharma are different, and Krishna went on to explain in Geeta, that karma is dharma`. Samay even touched how dharma isn't required when satya is there. All of this played part in shaping me - I kind of stopped praying. I completely stopped worshiping. Altough I continued wishing two pointers in the first wish to come true. I still do. But, it has changed to what I can do than what would god do. Today, I don't even believe in god in the form they are described in religions.¬†</p>\n<p>Fast forward to 2014, I just wanted to get a good govt job to make my family financially stable. I was still playing cricket and had a dream of making it big one day. But reality was more closer. I had to get a job. I hadn't tought it through to be honest. My brother always wanted to join Army. He joined them in 2015. This was a financial releif. He was just 17, his actual age. I was 18 and half. We decided if He is going through it, I have to make it big now.¬†</p>\n<p>At this point, I knew I wasn't going to make it big in cricket. I kind of started to hate it in reality. As I saw age frauding happening at big scale from u15 days, back in 2012. Never had that real fire for it afterwards. Now since I could aford to take sometime and We decided to do somthing big, I had to find what is it. <em><strong>I figured doing Civil services would be perfect</strong></em>. I could make a lot of impact, plus make good money. But before this thought could have been matured, I joined a computer class - Nielit O level. Loved it completely, excelled at it. And suddenly the startup door was opened.¬†</p>\n<p>I had been great with people always. Had been in between them, motivating them, guiding them. I find a different energy. Plus I bring the average up. I had been doing odd businesses and handling finances for a long lnog time -</p>\n<p>1. I had started a sim card selling business</p>\n<p>2. I was also doing a soap selling business</p>\n<p>3. I also did Chappals and Shoe selling business during my college days to support myself and the family.¬†</p>\n<p>4. During the same time, I also tried selling utensils and notebooks.¬†</p>\n<p>5. I was always good with money. In school days, I used to save my pocket money and lend to my father in tough times.¬†</p>\n<p>I was kind of a book worm in school days, and I had read about a lot of famous personalities, making it big from 0. Again back in 2016, I was reading about startup folks - Bezos, Zuckerberg, Musk. Kind of impact they had. I didn't have a laptop, nor a cs graduation. But I was doing well in my computer class course work. I was already reversing arrays, checking prime numbers, building job application platform. üòÖ. Felt like I was built for it. Felt like I found my calling. <em><strong>I wanted to build a software company - to create something world will use, to create wealth, to have influence, to have a huge impact.¬†</strong></em></p>\n<p>It was 2020, I was doing good at being a builder, being a software engineer. Earning decent money, giving back to society in own capacity, I realised what I always wanted to do - <em><strong>I wanted to have an impact in the world, to make it better, in whatever way I could, even say .00000001 percent</strong></em>.¬†</p>\n<p>I am writting this in 2024. And as I look back my wishes or dreams or goals you would say, have changed over times. Yet, I have stayed relatively happy and successful (peace) during each of those phase. At times, I wasn't doing what I love. <em><strong>But I aboslutely loved what I did</strong></em>. Wise words guiding to - focus on the proccess and not results helped tremendously.</p>\n<p>Is this the complete truth? As I delved deeper, I found that I always wanted to do one thing, I always loved one thing - which is <em><strong>making an impact.¬†</strong></em>How I expressed it changed over time, how I wanted to make this happen did chagne. But i look at the wishes, goals, core of it has been¬† driven by <em><strong>a fire to make an impact</strong></em>. Things are connecting now.¬†</p>\n<p>I have a mountain to move before I sleep, and there is only a little time.¬†</p>\n<p>See you!</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>In the 2nd week of September 2024, I flew to Mumbai for my b1/b2 US visa interview. Good news is I got the visa. On this note, I am sharing how I overprepared for the interview. And how, I often at times, overprepare.¬†</p>\n<p>The interviews were on 9th and 10th. I got good advices from Co-founders@Houseware and senior colleagues. And the visa agent too. My conclusion was to get as many documents supporting my case as possible. On 10th, the consular interview day, I had a big stack of dcouments with more than 35 pages. I was a bit early to the interview place. So, I had to wait outside, Entires were time sloted. So, I waited for my turn.</p>\n<p>I went in, waited on another queue, and finally met the interviewer. He asked a few basic questions, like - Where are you going? Why are you going? What do you do? Who is paying for the trip? And said `Your visa is approved`. Didn't look at any documents.¬†</p>\n<p>While heading back to hotel, I started thinking, the entire stack of documents, there weren't required. No one checked them. I felt like I overprepared for it. No, I hadn't done any interview preparations, as this was more of a factual interview, not a skill or presentation. But, I had done preparation to get these documents, get them printed. All for nothing?<br><br>One part of my brain started:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>¬†Hey, you prepared for the worst, and your job is a success. Why does it matter if you overprepared. What if they had actually asked for some of those documents. By preparing for the worst you were ready to face the worst. You could pull out ¬†any document they could have asked.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And the other half said</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yeah, this is legit. And I am not disappointed, and since you, have nudged myself to the final outcome, I am really happy that I got the job done. But, these kind of overpreparation has led me to missing out on opportunities earlier. Always going for perfection, preparing for the worst always, have let me down. Once, I was preparing for my Google Certified Web depeoper exams. Had a long planned preparation cycle. But, they stopped giving certifications before I felt ready.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>First half again</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Oh, I see you. Going for perfection, preparing for the worst shouldn't happen at the cost of never feeling ready. Prepare for the worst, go for the perfection but within your limited resources - 'time' especially. This often works like magic when you have to run faster but at the same time have space to re-try. 80-85% success, 15% failure is a sweet spot, tight your resources by opening your mind to 85% readiness. Plan like this. Then push extra for the 100%.¬†</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>¬†</p>\n<p>Makes sense now. Overpreparation is just preparation, when done with an obsession for the goal.¬†</p>\n<p>¬†</p>\n<p>Let's hit more goals üéØ</p>",
