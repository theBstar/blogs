There should be a goal I am working towards every week. This is a living document of 52 sprints.

Narayan is getting married on the 25th. And there is one more wedding tomorrow. So many weddings, and I can't have a good excuse to not attend any. I won't mind attending. I wanted to be in Pawan &amp; Narayan's wedding. It is gonna be fun. I shall catch up on some work during these days. I wasn't able to work much early this week due to travel. </p><p>I travelled to Nalbari last Sunday, and we had a game there. We were playing in the Chamata Higher Secondary field against Doctor 11. We lost the game. But it was fun. We had food on the ground. I stayed back. I had planned to be at Nalbari to meet a friend, irrespective of the game. First time I was gonna meet someone with this much dedication. I had a hotel, checked in, and after a few minutes, I met her outside. We went to a dining place on the rooftop and chatted for hours. I had met her on Facebook. I never thought I would have that long, easy conversation with someone, especially when meeting someone. I had a similar ease meeting people from Orange Health first time. It was fun, we went to the mela, and the next day we were doing a morning walk. If emotional intimacy is a thing, sure, it was. </p><p>I had my flight to Bangalore on Monday evening. I was staying at the Taj. I realised, I don't like VIP treatment. Well, I knew it. But I thought I could get through it, if it was paid experience. Turns out I can't. And I feel happy about it. I am never gonna turn into something I pitch against. I hate climate activists, staying in a 7-star hotel, whose bed linen is cleaned every day and attended by 4 people who are trained to do a nonsensical walk without making a sound. I don't feel someone doing an arti of mine for no reason while walking into a hotel. </p><p>Enough rant. Haven't made any other progress otherwise. Life hasn't moved much. Let it be soaking till the weddings. And I gather after that. With full force. Good night (11:30 pm).</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1jajp6jtp29">November 14th, 46th week</h2><p>Equal energy, I have been doing really great at work. I have done some building, although I haven't published it yet. Traveling to Bangalore next week &amp; a few weddings, I can act like it's another year by December and get publishing going. Have done a few runs. I have found that the focus mode in batting is reflected in the recent scores. I have been catching up on Sanskrit, but missed going to classes this week. The first half of the week was off track, I was sleeping really late, like 2 am, main reason for missing Sanskrit classes. I want to catch up well &amp; continue classes next week when I am back from Bangalore. I should download classes and keep them offline for travel. </p><p>Let's end strong, sleep, eat, fitness, and knowledge should be on track. 🤘</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1j97jt74418">November 4th, 45th week</h2><p>Cheers for the continuity 🎉 Just 7 weeks to. Time to push the pedal hard. I am hell consistent in every other aspect but one. The machine is running well. Need to build more. It feels like a jump somehow. I need to break it down into steps. Small baby steps. Do not set big ambitious goals, but just get the hang of it. </p><p>On the good side, did a 15k. This was the longest run after 2023. I got out of my room for a run, saw a colleague completing 15k on Strava, and commented, I am gonna do 15. I wasn't prepared physically. Mentally, I am always for anything. And these challenges make me feel alive. That run was the day before yesterday. Today I did a short jog for recovery. And some stretch, abs work to get them visible. I am pretty hopeful I will get them. I am gonna go on a calorie deficit after November. To ensure I get them visible. Till then, I will continue to have fun. </p><p>And maybe I also read a lot of Sanskrit grammar &amp; words and record a video saying a few lines this month. Seems like a decent goal. And next month I can end on high there as well. </p><h2 id="mcetoc_1j97jt74419">October 27th, 44th week</h2><p>Only 8 weeks to go. 7 after this. Have started attending Sanskrit classes. I attended the first class today and felt that I could learn a great deal in the class. I have to compete with kids, so I won't back away. Different feeling sitting on college desks again. 😆</p><p>And I have ticked a few boxes already</p><ul><li>Ran a 52-minute 10k ✅</li><li>Scored a 50 ✅</li><li>Learning Sanskrit, going to classes</li><li>I have done well in terms of acquiring knowledge, have read a ton of books, and have applied them where required. Have done well at work. Create space &amp; challenges for myself. ✅</li><li>Have been writing consistently - blog, poems, and some drawings, from time to time. ✅</li><li>I am fit. And as good as in my early 20s. Be it speed, agility, or stamina. ✅</li><li>Yeah, I am handling cash well. I don't have a lot of stash, but I can do better with investment. </li><li>Need to get those visible abs and 22 min 5k. Both connected, I guess. I shall be ticking this anyway in the next 8 weeks. </li><li>I haven't done any AI builds recently; the first half was full on blast. I need to do this. This is one thing I do better when I am away from home. I need to have 7 Twitter posts out in the next 7 weeks on building something, or hard for me to justify being at home. </li></ul><p>Time for me to double down and tick off the last 3. 🤘</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1j8a46cloi">October 24th, 43rd week</h2><p>The week went into the Diwali celebration and the U16 tournament finals. Played a match, read a few lessons on Sanskrit. Apart from this didn't make any progress. Oh, I wrote a few poems and <a href="https://suno.com/s/pNWtyMpKfE9MxkVZ">created a song using suno; listen to it here</a>. </p><p>I also scored a 50 on the 26th of October. Chasing numbers makes it easier to track 😅. A few more boxes to tick. </p><h2 id="mcetoc_1j7l80h5m1e">October 16th, 41st &amp; 42nd week</h2><p>The weeks post Dusshera have been really busy. Waking up early to get a head start at work. Going out for games (u16 tournament for kids) and coming back to work, life. Chaos. But I feel privileged to be able to pull this off. Not only have I pulled this off, but I have been thriving. <a href="https://x.com/thebstar13/status/1978307428274815119" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I am feeling so good, so pumped. I am back in flow state</a>. </p><p>For the updates</p><ul><li>I feel the best physically &amp; mentally - like a beast of 2019, 2020</li><li>Built a small prototype web app for interval training runs, need testing. </li><li>I am officially completely out of my temple duties. I had given my resignation in August 2024, but there were still a few strings attached. </li><li>I had good sessions with Spaceos, the startup I am advising. I shall try out the product and give similar feedback at regular intervals. </li><li>I haven't done much reading, but did some writing in this period. </li><li>Went to Morigaon for <a href="https://www.bcpl-t20.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BCPL</a></li></ul><h2 id="mcetoc_1j6p91h0c11">October 5th, 40th week</h2><p>Good Dusshera week. I wrote a wrap here - <a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/post-dussehra-run.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Post Dusshera Run</a></p><p>Highlights</p><ul><li>I learnt to play the dhol</li><li>I read a few chapters from the book Demand Side Sales, Bhagat Singh's letters, and Gandhi's biography. </li><li>I haven't yet published any app, but I am building and might release it. But I spent very little time here; I can do much, much better. </li><li>Didn't spare time for Sanskrit, couldn't do HM, I need more time, physically. </li></ul><h2 id="mcetoc_1j5l6uth31v">September 21st, week 39th &amp; 38th</h2><p>Assam is mourning the loss of Zubeen Garg, who passed away on September 19th. He was the true superstar this century that Assam produced. More than a singer, I always respected him for how he lived. He didn't fear controversy, nor did he chase fame. He was just who he was - a true artist, a revolutionary. He was out there with all his dignity, all his weaknesses, all good, bad, and ugly parts. As people grow in life, stature, and especially fame, they tend to hide it. He never did. </p><p>I had a pretty good week. I have been tracking my daytime energy for the last couple of days. I am very likely to wake up early, wake up energised, and do something early in the morning now again. Biggest win of the week. </p><p>Another feel-good moment was, we organized an NDRF awareness camp last week in the village community. These works are also my drugs. I need to reassess some of my priorities. On the other hand, I have always managed to find communities, anywhere I have been. </p><ol><li>Have been waking up consistently in the morning. Having a good day at work is also helping. </li><li>Have done a good amount of reading on tech, tech, and staff engineers' articles. Have been reading Gandhi's autobiography. </li><li>Have been consistent with running, and also sneaked in a cricket session. </li><li>I need to improve at building &amp; putting it out in public. No progress there. 🛑</li><li>Haven't read anything on Sanskrit. Feels, I have offloaded it to the coursework; classes haven't started. I don't even know if I am going to attend classes, hence doesn't make it depend on those classes. 🛑</li></ol><p>For everything that isn't ticked above, I have spent a lot of time on YouTube lately, maybe close to 10 hours each week. I will cut it out. Shall I remind you, I am the beast. </p><p><strong>September 27th</strong></p><p>Good day. Starting a week away from work. Finished the work on high. Gives me peace during the holidays. I planned to wander around pandals for this year. I will still accomplish some of this. But as the state is still in sorrow, I will have time to do other things. </p><ol><li>I shall build an app. I am feeling the need for an interval training app. There might be some already out there, but who cares? I am gonna make one &amp; release. </li><li>If not already obvious, I will do more runs this coming week, I must. Since I will be eating a lot.</li><li>I have the book demand side sales. Gonna read it. </li><li>I need to do something crazy, maybe a half-marathon next Sunday! ⚡</li><li>Sanskrit has taken a back seat, as I updated earlier; get back on track. I also dabbled with the thought of getting a musical instrument, but not the right time. I already have so many things on the plate. Let's finish the year strong and pick up music next. </li></ol><h2 id="mcetoc_1j4opns8jv">September 10th, week 37th</h2><p>I broke 52 minutes 10k with just two 10k runs this season. I am a beast. If anything, yes, I am doing well with my fitness. Got new shoes, Asics Nosa tri 16. All set to tick health boxes. Just need regular abs work. Speaking of which, I am trying to flip run/stretch time to morning. I am writing this update at 8 am in the morning for the same reason. </p><ul><li>Have some movement on wealth, more like a long-term investment, but that should bring my liquidity down to what I want IG. Let me calculate and update later. Yeah, liquidity should be as I have already committed (waiting for the process to get over), which is right now below 10% of the total assets. But processes are going to take some time, so I get to play with what I have for now. </li><li>On knowledge, I didn't do anything last week on Sanskrit. I enrolled in a class; classes start next week. Irrespective of the classes, I should do my part. <ul><li>Have been reading Experiment with Truths. </li><li>I shall read a few things about Staff engineer, as I have a chat with Sonesh next week, &amp; we were discussing the same thing, I should have read it earlier. ✅ <strong>Read it today - 14th of Sept. </strong></li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>14th September</strong></p><p>The biggest failure, I haven't really published anything on building the leverage. I got a really good comment on my old tutorial on Medium, but that won't count. </p><p>I have, however, started running in the morning. I am planning to have a good block in the morning for a run and build privilege. Starting Tuesday next week (the day after tomorrow). </p><h2 id="mcetoc_1j4erg8ub29">September 6th, week 36th</h2><p>Last 4 months. Considering December will be a bit lighter, this is almost the last quarter. I want to push for everything in these last 4 months. </p><ul><li>Health is a check ✅. This has been a good week. Did a 10K finally. I was struggling mentally to hold it for 10k. Had walked out around 7k at least 3 times. Went a little slower at the start and caught up later, most importantly, completed 10k. I am as good physically as I would have imagined. I need all visible abs in the next 4 months. This is the best year to have them. </li><li>Leverage, it is Saturday, and I have done nothing so far;<ul><li>I need to put my stuff out there. </li><li>I should move my liquidity somewhere. Will have some movements next week.</li></ul></li><li>Knowledge<ul><li>Haven't really built anything outside of work</li><li>At work, have worked on new feature test suites - so 1 new work stream. </li></ul></li><li>On the bonus track<ul><li>I have enrolled in a Sanskrit course in a college, where I have to be physically present at least once a week. Let's see where it goes. If it can keep me accountable &amp; accelerate my learning - that would be it. I don't care about certifications. </li><li>Social impact is moving. I had asked the NDRF to organise an awareness camp; it looks like it is going to happen. I need to drive a few people. It will have a great impact. Maybe I can sleep for the rest of the year after this 😆</li><li>I was close to scoring a 50. Luck has planned something of a better story for me, maybe. It is going to happen soon. Let's continue the process.  </li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="mcetoc_1j406l9np85">August 31st, week 35th</h2><p>August is dead. Missed exactly 2 updates. I am not allowed to go back and write. </p><ul><li>Apart from one lingering uncertainty, I have been at peace</li><li>Maybe a bit more comfortable than what I would have liked</li><li>Missed running the last few weeks. Exactly 3 weeks, Ig. Running fixes me. Did a run this week, and here I am back writing. Although I wrote a few notes during the last 3 weeks. </li><li>Have been spending some time learning Sanskrit. Started reading My Experiments with Truth. It was in my collection for some time. I like how well written the pre-text is. I like the transparency and how he puts no curtain, but shows his evolution as a person, as a thinker. No one is perfect, and we are all chasing something. </li><li>I have been running my Social detox mid-year this time. I am going to set up recurring payments every quarter from here. </li><li>Health and knowledge are two things from the list I am topping; leverage is something I am not doing well. I should really double down on these coming few months. <ul><li><strong>Let me break it down into building something, even as useless as it is, and publishing a written blog about it somewhere, maybe on Medium or LinkedIn, once every 2 weeks.</strong> </li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="mcetoc_1j406l9np86">August 4th, week 32nd</h2><ul><li>Wealth, Run, Sanskrit &amp; a great hackathon that is all going to be the week. </li><li>Was part of the winning hackathon team. Well, the PA team won 5 prizes in total. Crazy visionaries &amp; top-level execution bundled. </li></ul><h2 id="mcetoc_1j1ob9s32o">August 3rd, week 31st</h2><p>Writing this on a Sunday evening. This was koala week—slow, lazy, a bit of biking, running, and taking mom to the hospital. I had initially planned to build something, but ended up doing nothing. There are good signs too - health is on track, I feel fitter, leaner, and faster. I played a game start of the week - was bowling well, batting well, and did a brilliant diving save. All thanks to the speed workout I have done this week. ~4.10s km lap feels not so tough. Breathing has become better. </p><ul><li>Next week will be a hackathon at work. Will have a lot of fun. </li><li>9 weeks to go on the Sanskrit track, I shall probably go back to the grammar book + 2 lectures a day. </li><li>And I hardly want to get a passive income going. Met a friend who is running a few businesses. He is way junior, has a few people working for him, kind of inspiring. </li><li>If I don't have passive income this week, I have failed in every aspect. Maybe I should go bald, as my teacher used to say. Let's write this down. I shall brainstorm on this separately. I wouldn't want people to read, but keeping it public makes me accountable. I can put some encoding, sounds like a plan. </li><li>Let's tick the wealth box next week; everything else is running well. </li></ul><h2 id="mcetoc_1j164635f4">July 24th, week 30th</h2><p>22 more weeks to go. I can write a few small sentences in Sanskrit, finally. Have exactly 22 weeks to become more fluent. Learn more words &amp; cases. Let's limit this to 10 weeks from next Monday. I can start reading small novels post that. To keep the interest going and go deeper into the language. Let's do the update</p><ul><li>Health ✅. I have been doing runs, I have been playing, waking up on time, and sleeping almost on time. It's been a streak run for the last couple of weeks. <ul><li>I had a long streak of regular crunches going. Broke the streak when I travelled to Bangalore last time, been a month. I should get back this week. </li></ul></li><li>Knowledge ✅ - Personally, as mentioned can write a few small Sanskrit sentences.<ul><li>Professionally, I have found a few places to grow. As the team grows, as I can foresee, scale problems - I have been trying to predict and build systems, technical &amp; people enablement. I have reset my calendar to reflect the same. Feels like re-writting my role, a sign of growth. I should read staff engineer articles this week &amp; update Sonesh. </li><li><span style="color: #e67e23;">Can I plan on getting back on technical writing or building? Let me plan this weekend</span>. </li></ul></li><li>Wealth - Bearish week. 🙁. I have just been holding. </li></ul><p>Sun 27th update</p><ul><li>Made a mess of my investment. Good, that I don't care much about it. Otherwise, I could have been losing my mind. But I have seen droughts. Have gone from -60% to 180%. But I should act this week. Even if holding. Should be conscious.  </li><li>Have been a little unwell. There are a few things on the food menu I am discovering to disturb me. Will do more observations before I make a call.</li><li>Will have a cracking next week. </li></ul><h2 id="mcetoc_1j0kho7102">July 14th, week 29th</h2><p>Welcome to another Monday. Had a great last weekend. Felt like a complete reset, and felt like a long, long weekend. Let's have another great week. ✌</p><p>Update July 19th, Saturday 12.05AM 😄</p><p>I had my laptop on my side for some time to write this. Got late. This was a good week. At work didn't even realise how fast it flew. Went to attend an event on Monday. Father wasn't feeling well, took him to the hospital on Tuesday. And I was kind of covering up for the week. That's the reason, IG. But the week itself was very productive. Have set up a sync going with a very senior dev on org impact. In my team, it is time for me to step up for the scaling of our systems, today was mostly that. </p><p>Personally, Have been consistent with runs. Did a 7K 🎉. Oh, I am still good, I am the best. Let's go to specifics</p><ul><li>Health ✅ - feeling good. Had a few good runs. Can be part of some more family chores. Gonna get them done on the weekends.</li><li>Knowledge ✅ - Learnt a few sentences of Sanskrit. Gonna complete the 100th page this weekend. That WILL BE 25%. </li><li>Wealth 🚫 - Haven't done anything. The 5% I made last week went up to 22%. Should have exited. Got greedy or better lazy. I do this. I must sell within a week &amp; rebalance. </li></ul><p>Should do more tech exploration this weekend. And some more family time. Will update by Sunday. </p><p>Update Mon July 21st, 12:03AM</p><p>Didn't do much technical or reading this weekend. Saturday was spent on earth filling the new plot we bought. Went to Konoka village resort on Sunday. Had some fun. Did some activities and fun clicks. Maybe I am better at a beach or a park, or similar places with my old clothes, where I don't have to think about getting them cleaned up after reaching home. 🤣</p><p>Having a light headache, need to fix my slowly slipping sleep schedule. SHUT DOWN BY 11:40 pm. Next week's goal. </p><h2 id="mcetoc_1ivhe1f6d3q">July 7th, Week 28th</h2><p>Almost feels like a repetition. Doesn't it?</p><p>What's the value of progress if it isn't directional? What's the value of speed if it is an oscillation?</p><p>I am part of Sikhsya Kalyan Nyash, which aims to elevate the educational environment in the area, but most I have seen is facilitation. But it is understandable, as most people don't have time, so they would rather give out money. Yesterday received the 3rd-yearly book they published. I had been contemplating whether to continue with it, the membership. Maybe it isn't much financially. But, you know, it isn't easy for me to just not be involved. Guess I will have to learn. </p><p>I would like to bring color coding back again</p><ul><li>Health - Played a few games ✅, in a very healthy mind state.<ul><li>I did take a few personal stances last week. I did put a status - It happens some fights I can't lose, even though I don't want to fight. So better to fight and fight for the glory. <a href="https://x.com/thebstar13/status/1939676038235365505">Read the tweet</a></li></ul></li><li>Wealth - Haven't done anything here 🛑</li><li>Knowledge - Just random reads, I gotta do better. Also, it is July, so, I should focus on learning a language. I don't want to come back and say I didn't learn a new language. 🛑</li></ul><p><strong>Update July 11 🕺</strong></p><ul><li>I feel I am back here. My schedule is patched back. One of the reasons I want to fly to Bangalore in July to meet new folks &amp; Div, but don't want to fly to not messing up my schedule. Gotta continue it for some time without any disruption.</li><li>With a few runs, games this week, health goals are checked ✅. Sleep is perfect.</li><li>On wealth: Haven't made any money but have surely taken a few bets this week. This is new for the year. It is happening. ⚡</li></ul><p><strong>July 12</strong></p><ul><li>This week was a solid ✅</li><li>I did some building -&gt; <a href="https://x.com/thebstar13/status/1944012117591695640" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Built an AI browser prototype</a></li><li>Have done a few good runs with my brother</li><li>Have been back at learning Sanskrit<ul><li>I have a 400-page book, down to the 86th page. </li></ul></li><li>I tried some bets on the wealth side, got a 5% return in a week. Mainly, it was a bullish week. </li><li>And I have one more day, this feels like me. Let me add a dance emoji 🕺</li></ul><p><strong>Running fixes me everytime</strong>. And writting, Plus conversations with same brain wave people. </p><h2 id="mcetoc_1iv3dil5414">July 1st, Week 27th</h2><p>Well, it's been a long, long time. 10 weeks 🤡</p><p>Honestly, have done nothing from this list. </p><p>- Have played a handful of cricket. Visited Kolkata. </p><p>I was regular at the fitness for some time, but went to Bangalore last week and continuity was broken. Need to get back this week. </p><h2 id="mcetoc_1ipg9p4jh4a">April 23rd, Week 17th</h2><p>Was in Bangalore last week, week 16th. Back home now. The good news is knee felt really good last week. Didn't even feel a pinch in slow runs. It still hurt when I went full-blown sprinting. Bad news - didn't do much activity last week. I am home this week. The schedule will be back. </p><p>Did an all-nighter on Monday as I was feeling a little rusty. Still, this week will be a mix of work, hustle &amp; social events - have a few weddings to attend. </p><p>We had company on-site, and met everyone in India. I met the spaces team. Pretty cool to see everyone in person. </p><p>I pulled the Google Analytics today, so good to see Kidli getting organic signups. I am sitting at 8. Not much, but yes. Should I build the thing? Considering I have MSFT credits and just put it online. Maybe I should. </p><ol><li><span style="color: #2dc26b;">1 run exactly, a few pushups</span></li><li><span style="color: #169179;">Did some reading - Leading effective engineering</span></li><li><span style="color: #f1c40f;">Met friends, work friends. </span></li><li><span style="color: #e03e2d;">Didn't do any building on side. </span></li><li><span style="color: #2dc26b;">I have setup 1:1 with a very senior engg in LD.

Waking up early, sleeping probably less than ideal. But exercising well. Knees are starting to feel a little better. </p><p>Haven't read anything this week so far. Haven't published anything so far. BAU in work life. </p><h2 id="mcetoc_1inmm5m8i4t">March 31st, Week 14th</h2><p>I have a few (two or three) sit-downs in front of computer tasks, each lasting 15-30 minutes, but I have procrastinated. This is the week I shall get them done. </p><p>Update on last week, Did one good run. A couple of stretches. Okay, I won't count them as quality/intent wasn't there. Did some reading - Thinking in Bets and Consumption. Got good sleep.</p><p>Cricket season has winded up. I also felt like taking a rest last week. Still got pulled into 2 matches. Wasted my time wildly last week. I binge-watched Marvel Punisher. Woke up way out of schedule on Saturday &amp; Sunday. Full awake midnights give me energy. This week I plan to use them in a more like 'me'. 🤘</p><ol><li><span style="color: #169179;">Get good 3 runs &amp; 7 days of full body stretch. </span></li><li><span style="color: #ba372a;">MCP, set up</span> &amp; <span style="color: #169179;">play with them</span>. <span style="color: #ba372a;">Post something by the end of the week.</span></li><li><span style="color: #169179;">Read.

Not sure if I will end up opening the Assamese book. Will take a hell lot of energy from me to do that. One isn't fiction so maybe I will open it. </li><li><span style="color: #ba372a;">By the weekend - close all housekeeping digital work pending on me. </span></li></ol><p>Update here by the end of the week. </p><p>Update: Week went well in terms of all 3 but the 4th item.
