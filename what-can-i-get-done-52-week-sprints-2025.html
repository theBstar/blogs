This one question from him doing rounds on x.com - 'What did you get done this week?'. By asking this every week, I can infuse the urgency. The answer to this should be directional. There should be a goal I am working towards every week. This is a living document of 52 sprints.  </p><p><strong>Here is the direction - </strong></p><ol><li>Leverage - Wealth, brand. Questions to answer - <br><ul><li>How much money did I make?</li><li>How many people did I reach?</li><li>How many valuable connections did I make?</li></ul></li><li>Health - Let's have the visible abs this year. If not this year it isn't happening anytime. Questions to answer<ul><li>What did I do this week to have visible abs?</li><li>Did I sleep well? Oversleep, under-sleep?</li></ul></li><li>Knowledge - Be on top of AI and establish engineering excellence in the network. Math is back. <ul><li>What did I learn?</li><li>What did I build &amp; publish on the web? Engineering Article, new product, open source contribution?</li><li>What did I read?</li><li>What did I learn in math?</li></ul></li></ol><p>I will pursue items from this list, but all of them are secondary, and I should not be judged by them. I have a wishlist that includes playing plenty of cricket matches, achieving a new personal record for a half marathon, learning a language (which was my goal for 2024), learning to play a musical instrument, and writing more poems and sketches. However, I should not be judged by these pursuits. When the year ends, I want to review and check off the above three items. If I can check off anything from the wishlist, that will be a bonus. </p><p>Let's start ⚡</p><p> </p><h2>Week 4 (Week of 20th Jan)</h2><ol><li>Health - Resume Gym (have been off from mid-2024)</li><li>Leverage -<ul><li>Money - I have 1L to play around and generate a return from the market/crypto/physical investment. Set up a plan/schedule this week. So that I can start thinking/executing from next week. Can I grow it X% in 3 months (X to be filled)?</li></ul></li><li>Knowledge<ul><li>Get back to reading AI.</li><li>Be on track to complete 11th math by next week.  </li></ul></li></ol><p> </p><h2>Week 1 to 3</h2><p>I didn't get anything done in these 3 weeks that aligned with the direction I had set. I am here finalizing the direction on the <strong>4th week, 20th of Jan</strong>. Hence, Can I say I created the clarity? Saying this, I did start re-reading the 11th Math book. Read Set theory, functions, and Relations.</p><p> </p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on January 20, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/tags/daily/">daily</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fwhat-can-i-get-done-52-week-sprints-2025.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fwhat-can-i-get-done-52-week-sprints-2025.html&amp;via=thebstar13&amp;text=What%20can%20I%20get%20done%20(52-week%20sprints)%20-%202025" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fwhat-can-i-get-done-52-week-sprints-2025.html" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=What%20can%20I%20get%20done%20(52-week%20sprints)%20-%202025 https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fwhat-can-i-get-done-52-week-sprints-2025.html" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/authors/bikram/" rel="author">Bikram Sutar</a></h3><div class="bio__desc"><p>Hey, I am Bikram and this is my blog. </p></div></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/the-horizon-december-2024.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><figure class="content__nav-image"><img src="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/media/posts/21/responsive/Screenshot-2024-12-30-at-10.58.01-PM-xs.png" class="lazyload" loading="lazy" alt="Horizon" height="582" width="582"></figure><div><span>Previous</span> The Horizon - December 2024</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h4 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><figure class="feed__image related__image"><img src="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/media/posts/9/Screenshot-2024-09-26-at-1.13.58-AM.png" srcset="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot-2024-09-26-at-1.13.58-AM-xs.png 640w, https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot-2024-09-26-at-1.13.58-AM-sm.png 768w, https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/media/posts/9/responsive/Screenshot-2024-09-26-at-1.13.58-AM-md.png 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 600px) calc(4.38vw + 143px), 87.86vw" loading="lazy" height="676" width="1062" alt="Shaktiman flying"></figure><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/authors/bikram/" class="feed__author">Bikram Sutar</a> <time datetime="2024-09-26T01:14" class="feed__date">September 26, 2024</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/do-what-you-love-or-love-what-you-do.html">Do what you love, Or love what you do</a></h3></header><p>I wanted to be a superman.
