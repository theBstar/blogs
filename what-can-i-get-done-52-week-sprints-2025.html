This one question from him is doing rounds on x.com - 'What did you get done this week?'. By asking this every week, I can infuse the urgency. The answer to this should be directional. There should be a goal I am working towards every week. This is a living document of 52 sprints.

I can write a few small sentences in Sanskrit, finally. Have exactly 22 weeks to become more fluent. Learn more words &amp; cases. Let's limit this to 10 weeks from next Monday. I can start reading small novels post that. To keep the interest going and go deeper into the language. Let's do the update</p><ul><li>Health ✅. I have been doing runs, I have been playing, waking up on time, and sleeping almost on time. It's been a streak run for the last couple of weeks. <ul><li>I had a long streak of regular crunches going. Broke the streak when I travelled to Bangalore last time, been a month. I should get back this week. </li></ul></li><li>Knowledge ✅ - Personally, as mentioned can write a few small Sanskrit sentences.<ul><li>Professionally, I have found a few places to grow. As the team grows, as I can foresee, scale problems - I have been trying to predict and build systems, technical &amp; people enablement. I have reset my calendar to reflect the same. Feels like re-writting my role, a sign of growth. I should read staff engineer articles this week &amp; update Sonesh. </li><li><span style="color: #e67e23;">Can I plan on getting back on technical writing or building? Let me plan this weekend</span>. </li></ul></li><li>Wealth - Bearish week. 🙁. I have just been holding. </li></ul><h2> </h2><h2 id="mcetoc_1j0kho7102">July 14th, week 29th</h2><p>Welcome to another Monday. Had a great last weekend. Felt like a complete reset, and felt like a long, long weekend. Let's have another great week. ✌</p><p>Update July 19th, Saturday 12.05AM 😄</p><p>I had my laptop on my side for some time to write this. Got late. This was a good week. At work didn't even realise how fast it flew. Went to attend an event on Monday. Father wasn't feeling well, took him to the hospital on Tuesday. And I was kind of covering up for the week. That's the reason, IG. But the week itself was very productive. Have set up a sync going with a very senior dev on org impact. In my team, it is time for me to step up for the scaling of our systems, today was mostly that. </p><p>Personally, Have been consistent with runs. Did a 7K 🎉. Oh, I am still good, I am the best. Let's go to specifics</p><ul><li>Health ✅ - feeling good. Had a few good runs. Can be part of some more family chores. Gonna get them done on the weekends.</li><li>Knowledge ✅ - Learnt a few sentences of Sanskrit. Gonna complete the 100th page this weekend. That WILL BE 25%. </li><li>Wealth 🚫 - Haven't done anything. The 5% I made last week went up to 22%. Should have exited. Got greedy or better lazy. I do this. I must sell within a week &amp; rebalance. </li></ul><p>Should do more tech exploration this weekend. And some more family time. Will update by Sunday. </p><p>Update Mon July 21st, 12:03AM</p><p>Didn't do much technical or reading this weekend. Saturday was spent on earth filling the new plot we bought. Went to Konoka village resort on Sunday. Had some fun. Did some activities and fun clicks. Maybe I am better at a beach or a park, or similar places with my old clothes, where I don't have to think about getting them cleaned up after reaching home. 🤣</p><p>Having a light headache, need to fix my slowly slipping sleep schedule. SHUT DOWN BY 11:40 pm. Next week's goal. </p><h2 id="mcetoc_1ivhe1f6d3q">July 7th, Week 28th</h2><p>Almost feels like a repetition. Doesn't it?</p><p>What's the value of progress if it isn't directional? What's the value of speed if it is an oscillation?</p><p>I am part of Sikhsya Kalyan Nyash, which aims to elevate the educational environment in the area, but most I have seen is facilitation. But it is understandable, as most people don't have time, so they would rather give out money. Yesterday received the 3rd-yearly book they published. I had been contemplating whether to continue with it, the membership. Maybe it isn't much financially. But, you know, it isn't easy for me to just not be involved. Guess I will have to learn. </p><p>I would like to bring color coding back again</p><ul><li>Health - Played a few games ✅, in a very healthy mind state.<ul><li>I did take a few personal stances last week. I did put a status - It happens some fights I can't lose, even though I don't want to fight. So better to fight and fight for the glory. <a href="https://x.com/thebstar13/status/1939676038235365505">Read the tweet</a></li></ul></li><li>Wealth - Haven't done anything here 🛑</li><li>Knowledge - Just random reads, I gotta do better. Also, it is July, so, I should focus on learning a language. I don't want to come back and say I didn't learn a new language. 🛑</li></ul><p><strong>Update July 11 🕺</strong></p><ul><li>I feel I am back here. My schedule is patched back. One of the reasons I want to fly to Bangalore in July to meet new folks &amp; Div, but don't want to fly to not messing up my schedule. Gotta continue it for some time without any disruption.</li><li>With a few runs, games this week, health goals are checked ✅. Sleep is perfect.</li><li>On wealth: Haven't made any money but have surely taken a few bets this week. This is new for the year. It is happening. ⚡</li></ul><p><strong>July 12</strong></p><ul><li>This week was a solid ✅</li><li>I did some building -&gt; <a href="https://x.com/thebstar13/status/1944012117591695640" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Built an AI browser prototype</a></li><li>Have done a few good runs with my brother</li><li>Have been back at learning Sanskrit<ul><li>I have a 400-page book, down to the 86th page. </li></ul></li><li>I tried some bets on the wealth side, got a 5% return in a week. Mainly, it was a bullish week. </li><li>And I have one more day, this feels like me. Let me add a dance emoji 🕺</li></ul><p><strong>Running fixes me everytime</strong>. And writting, Plus conversations with same brain wave people. </p><h2 id="mcetoc_1iv3dil5414">July 1st, Week 27th</h2><p>Well, it's been a long, long time. 10 weeks 🤡</p><p>Honestly, have done nothing from this list. </p><p>- Have played a handful of cricket. Visited Kolkata. </p><p>I was regular at the fitness for some time, but went to Bangalore last week and continuity was broken. Need to get back this week. </p><h2 id="mcetoc_1ipg9p4jh4a">April 23rd, Week 17th</h2><p>Was in Bangalore last week, week 16th. Back home now. The good news is knee felt really good last week. Didn't even feel a pinch in slow runs. It still hurt when I went full-blown sprinting. Bad news - didn't do much activity last week. I am home this week. The schedule will be back. </p><p>Did an all-nighter on Monday as I was feeling a little rusty. Still, this week will be a mix of work, hustle &amp; social events - have a few weddings to attend. </p><p>We had company on-site, and met everyone in India. I met the spaces team. Pretty cool to see everyone in person. </p><p>I pulled the Google Analytics today, so good to see Kidli getting organic signups. I am sitting at 8. Not much, but yes. Should I build the thing? Considering I have MSFT credits and just put it online. Maybe I should. </p><ol><li><span style="color: #2dc26b;">1 run exactly, a few pushups</span></li><li><span style="color: #169179;">Did some reading - Leading effective engineering</span></li><li><span style="color: #f1c40f;">Met friends, work friends. </span></li><li><span style="color: #e03e2d;">Didn't do any building on side. </span></li><li><span style="color: #2dc26b;">I have setup 1:1 with a very senior engg in LD. I should do this with more folks and learn from them.</span></li></ol><h2 id="mcetoc_1ipg9p4jh4b">April 10th, Week 15th</h2><p>Have been holding up well in terms of fitness. Waking up early, sleeping probably less than ideal. But exercising well. Knees are starting to feel a little better. </p><p>Haven't read anything this week so far. Haven't published anything so far. BAU in work life. </p><h2 id="mcetoc_1inmm5m8i4t">March 31st, Week 14th</h2><p>I have a few (two or three) sit-downs in front of computer tasks, each lasting 15-30 minutes, but I have procrastinated. This is the week I shall get them done. </p><p>Update on last week, Did one good run. A couple of stretches. Okay, I won't count them as quality/intent wasn't there. Did some reading - Thinking in Bets and Consumption. Got good sleep.</p><p>Cricket season has winded up. I also felt like taking a rest last week. Still got pulled into 2 matches. Wasted my time wildly last week. I binge-watched Marvel Punisher. Woke up way out of schedule on Saturday &amp; Sunday. Full awake midnights give me energy. This week I plan to use them in a more like 'me'. 🤘</p><ol><li><span style="color: #169179;">Get good 3 runs &amp; 7 days of full body stretch. </span></li><li><span style="color: #ba372a;">MCP, set up</span> &amp; <span style="color: #169179;">play with them</span>. <span style="color: #ba372a;">Post something by the end of the week.</span></li><li><span style="color: #169179;">Read. I have a new book on leading engineering teams that I haven't opened.</span> I have exactly two Assamese books I bought from a book fair 2 months back, I haven't opened them yet. Not sure if I will end up opening the Assamese book. Will take a hell lot of energy from me to do that. One isn't fiction so maybe I will open it. </li><li><span style="color: #ba372a;">By the weekend - close all housekeeping digital work pending on me. </span></li></ol><p>Update here by the end of the week. </p><p>Update: Week went well in terms of all 3 but the 4th item. I don't know if I will ever open those Assamese books.</p><h2 id="mcetoc_1in9scsd8ei">March 26th, Week 13th</h2><p>Honestly, I don't remember which week this is (the 13th, I googled it). I haven't been able to tick anything from the above list. Although</p><ul><li>Health<ul><li>I have been sleeping well. A good number of hours. ~8. I want to bring it down to 6/7. </li><li>I have also started doing a few runs. Not regular yet.</li><li>Physically, look-wise, I am not way far from abs.
