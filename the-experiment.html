I have 4 lakhs at my disposal to run bootstrap experiments.</p><p>I have 2 months to pick signals, 2 months to double down, and have clarity if this path is going to work.</p><p><strong>April 30th is the checkpoint for deciding where and whether I double down.</strong></p><p><strong>June 30th is the deadline for this. </strong></p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1ji484iqhj0">Strategy</h3><p>Build useful things, figure out useful things by talking to people, releasing, and distributing. Show the value quickly to the user, and get them to pay as soon as possible. I can't give unlimited freemium, or I will go broke 🤐</p><p>I am mostly going to focus on b2c niche apps and ideas. And on the side, I will also try to find a big b2b idea. Talk to people - cofounders, vcs, early employees - to find the big idea. </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1ji484iqhj1">Plan</h3><p>The plan is to run several independent experiments in b2c initially. Work on 3 things in parallel</p><ol><li>Build and ship - Staying on top of the fast-moving tech</li><li>Distribute - Marketing and organic leveraging AI<ul><li>Content creation </li></ul></li><li>Solve problem for people - POCs, brainstorming, so I get more ideas around the newly evolving build and distribution model. </li></ol><p>If things work, I shall have </p><ol><li>A few apps - generating revenue</li><li>A few stores, selling products</li><li>A few content labs, generating AI content - initially, short marketing content. Later can be creative content</li><li>A new combined distribution model that is proven and can be replicated. </li></ol><p>Making content, marketing - generating leads - top of the funnel, and converting that to purchases, I believe there is a big value. Starting with content gives me space to iterate on this loop faster. </p><h4 id="mcetoc_1ji484iqhj2">Week 1 - Feb last week</h4><ul><li>Matrum POC. </li><li>Create Apple Developer account</li><li>Warm up reddit, x - post at least 3 content</li><li>Use Claude extensively at work, and figure out whether to buy a cursor or Claude for personal purchase on Sunday.
