I will call it a day for today. </p><p><strong>Week 1 starts tomorrow 🎬</strong></p><p>I will be in Bangalore at least till December end. I saw a year progression tweet - 80% is done. We have only 20% left of 2024. Time to buckle up. This is a live document for week 1. </p><p>Before we start, I have a few goals - </p><ul><li>Setup the place ✅</li><li>Hit the gym ✅</li><li>Cricket practice 2 days a week 🔴</li><li>Eat and sleep well - it is a long game. ✅</li><li>Build the first version of Kidli - Web send to select parents. - Instead did a soft signup launch - got the first signup. 🟡 🥳</li><li>Build the Kidli App (ios/android) - Do a release </li><li>Get 100 paid parents</li><li>Publish articles - Tech, Leadership, learnings - 2 articles a week. 🟡</li></ul><p>Note: I might change some in November but until then let's run with these. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Day 0 - Sunday, October 20th 2024</strong></p><ul><li>Received the rejection email from <a href="https://www.zfellows.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ZFellows</a> - Without any traction &amp; a co-founder it was kind of obvious. But hey, It fast-tracked my pitch deck and solidified the space. Talked to a few potential users, which I was delaying otherwise. </li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Day 1 - Monday, October 21st 2024</strong></p><ul><li>Setup wifi, room ✅, few things pending - take delivery of chair, a big bucket since the area seems to have some water issues, bedsheet &amp; a pillow</li><li>Fixed gym - hitting from tomorrow. Found a cricket club - a scheduled match on Sunday. ✅</li><li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Should have Kidli API running today</span>. 🧑‍💻 Update: Only got basic Azure open ai llm wrapper setup. Didn't complete this. </li></ul><p><strong>Day 2 - Tuesday, October 22nd 2024</strong></p><ul><li>Had a good day at work. Did some WebGPU experiments. ✅</li><li>Didn't make much progress on the personal front. </li><li>Okay, went to the gym. First day! ✅</li><li>Caught cold somehow 🥶</li></ul><p><strong>Day 3 - Wednesday, October 23rd 2024</strong></p><ul><li>Cold got worse. Wasn't at 100%, to be honest. </li><li>Initially, I thought I would take a complete break, could only sleep so many hours. Later did some experiments at work.</li><li>Yes, Went to the gym. ✅ I picked myself up. I could have had a better day. These cold and all shouldn't stop me. Show up! to Everything, Everywhere committed!</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Mid-week thoughts </strong></p><p>There have been a few observations and thoughts that have slowed things down. But it shouldn't really—time to re-center the focus. I need to release a v0 this week. Even if it means just an LLM wrapper. </p><p>Also, and it is an old realization, My day outside of work is heavily proportionate to my day at work. I should find ways to do the best work at any cost. Or start decoupling these two for the better. </p><p>Looking forward to the next 3 days! And a game on Sunday 🏏</p><p><strong>Day 4 - Thursday, October 24th 2024</strong></p><ul><li>Rested from gym.  I will share my complete schedule for accountability. I shall update my calendar. And sell myself to the calendar. </li><li>Had a good day at work - solved a few issues, helped fix one critical issue, and ran one good experiment. I am thinking of writing one article tomorrow on at least one experiment I ran in the week. ✅</li><li>My Google Play console account verification was out of date. Updated - it took some time. Hope verification completes soon. 🟡 I would have liked to have at least the auth part solved today, but I couldn't do it. Let's do it tomorrow. I want to see a big check tomorrow. </li></ul><p><strong>Day 5 - Friday, October 25th 2024</strong></p><ul><li>Not much progress on Kidli</li><li>Work wise a good day. Great demo by the team ✅</li></ul><p><strong>Day 6 - Saturday, October 26th 2024</strong></p><ul><li>Talked to an Edtech expert, with deep expertise in building learning experiences. Provided some references to people working in the space in India.</li><li>Also found Thecuriousparent, thanks to an old friend, Seems like the guy is fighting the exact problem. Would be interesting to talk to. Let's see if I can set up a chat.</li><li>Went deeper reading into b2b sales. Good all-nighter. Slept around 4, back at 8 with full energy. </li></ul><p><strong>Day 7 - Sunday, October 27th 2024</strong></p><ul><li>Soft launched Kidli - Updated website, added Google Analytics, added waitlist form &amp; sent to parent groups, and Reddit. I must figure out if I can publicly put it on my socials. Socials reminded me, that I should add social links to the homepage. ✅</li><li> Got one signup. It always starts like 0, 1, ... 🥳</li><li>Had planned to go for a run, but missed. </li></ul><p> </p><p>Overall, it was a productive week. Got some work done, plus good food &amp; physical activity. I am writing this at 7.15 pm IST. Had a long screen time today, and I will be reading some books now. </p><p>It is only going to get better from here. 💪</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 27, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/tags/startups/">startups</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fweek-1.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fweek-1.html&amp;via=thebstar13&amp;text=Week%201%20%F0%9F%8E%AC%20-%20%F0%9F%A5%B3%20(in%20Bangalore%20Nov%202024)" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fweek-1.html" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Week%201%20%F0%9F%8E%AC%20-%20%F0%9F%A5%B3%20(in%20Bangalore%20Nov%202024) https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fweek-1.html" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/authors/bikram/" rel="author">Bikram Sutar</a></h3><div class="bio__desc"><p>Hey, I am Bikram.
