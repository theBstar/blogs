No, it isn't a typo for Crash, which I also had a few years ago. The front bonnet of the car I was driving was destroyed. Thankfully, I wasn't even hurt. Changed me to realise small joys even more &amp; drive more carefully. Well, that's a different story. A blissful evening all by myself is better spent structuring my Crush story. </p><h3>My heart dropped a beat</h3><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/media/posts/33/Screenshot-2025-07-20-at-12.29.39-AM.png" alt="" width="620" height="527" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/media/posts/33/responsive/Screenshot-2025-07-20-at-12.29.39-AM-xs.png 640w, https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/media/posts/33/responsive/Screenshot-2025-07-20-at-12.29.39-AM-sm.png 768w, https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/media/posts/33/responsive/Screenshot-2025-07-20-at-12.29.39-AM-md.png 1024w, https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/media/posts/33/responsive/Screenshot-2025-07-20-at-12.29.39-AM-lg.png 1366w, https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/media/posts/33/responsive/Screenshot-2025-07-20-at-12.29.39-AM-xl.png 1600w, https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/media/posts/33/responsive/Screenshot-2025-07-20-at-12.29.39-AM-2xl.png 1920w">     </figure><p>I was at a wedding, sitting beside a beautiful lady, married. She asked me -</p><p>She - When are you getting married?</p><p>Me - I don't know</p><p><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">She - Why?</span></p><p>Me - Because I haven't found anyone compatible.</p><p>I didn't want to make it a long answer. I didn't want to tell her a lot, explain what I was thinking. We weren't that connected. We were in a wedding venue, and had to scream every time to be audible. I thought we could move on from the conversation with this answer. She asked</p><p><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">She - How? Why did you not set someone up?</span></p><p>She giggled and went on to mention how everyone is doing love marriage, and not seeing someone is a bad idea. </p><p>Oh, boy, for a second my heart dropped a beat. For a second, I wanted to tell her - <strong>because I HAD A CRUSH ON YOU. It was a long time back, but it was special</strong>.</p><p>It would have been a scene. I don't mind paying for such a scene. You know the saying, Thoughts travel faster than light. It did, and it did ruin the scene. I didn't tell her anything. I laughed, agreed, and moved on. In an alternate universe, I would have screamed for sure. </p><p> </p><h3>How beautiful she is <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">(was)</span></h3><p>She was really beautiful. And beauty is all in the eyes; it depends on who is looking and what they are looking at. I am not gonna give specifics for you people to figure this out. And if you feel like the girl, no, you weren't. Even when we had the above conversation. I had similar conversations with a lot of you in a very similar setup. What else do we have in common to talk otherwise? Maybe that was you. Keep reading. You had a great impact.</p><p>I had a crush on her. She was really beautiful. She had beautiful eyes. She was caring and full of optimism. She was so perfect. Felt my heart was beating for her - <a href="https://youtu.be/iasxMdSu7Jo?si=7h__RoE6Yog1wHig">jiya dhadak, dhadak jaye (Youtube link)</a>. This was the song I had shared with my friend. </p><p>The crush lasted for maybe 2/3 months. I never told her. I am the opposite of an impulse doer. In people I used to observe and observe. For things I used to procrastinate, this is my trick to stay under my budget. I was observing her - she gave me hope every day. She. gave me optimism every day. We didn't talk about these things - ever. But she did give me all the energy I needed at that time. Optimism was all I needed at that time. </p><p>After 2/3 months, the crush faded away. Seeing her again never gave me the same blush. I used to have high expectations from people - on parameters like honesty, keeping a lot of self-pride, being specific and conscious about ownself. She wasn't there in many of those parameters, I realised. I still felt special, I still felt in love, but a picture of her faded in my heart.</p><p>She taught me love, well, she doesn't know she taught me. She taught me the purest form of love. I used to walk on the field (Barikhar Khetir Ali) in monsoon rain, to help father in farming, I used to write songs, and I started writing poems. A heavy rain still takes me back to that feeling. I wasn't in love with her anymore; <strong>I started loving the feeling of love </strong>instead. I used to go for a run, and I thought someone was watching. This used to make me feel special; it still does. I used to write thinking someone was reading, and I still do. I am still blushing. Optimism that feeling gave me, I felt special, every time I fell, that feeling was there to pick me up.</p><p>I have never described this. I don't know how to describe. I feel I can write a poem, and that will explain this better. That feeling made me cheer the monsoon rain, sing blue sky, and clouds; that feeling helped me be where I am. I am not an artist, not a school-trained traditional one, but still, that feeling made me one. Or so I like to believe. </p><p> </p><h3>The gift of love</h3><p>As I said, her picture has faded, and I don't even remember well how she looked back then. I tried one day remembering her very hard in the middle of a reflection time, plus rain. No, I couldn't remember her face. But this feeling is eternal. This feeling of love, of being special - this is going to last with me forever. This gives me optimism, as it was a big part of the hopes I had. It is a big part of the peace I have. It is so pure, I look at parents and find the same kind of love. It is all about giving and not expecting anything in return. But it gives so much back. I have seen fathers giving up their drinking habit, and I have seen mothers becoming stronger, more resilient, confident, and independent. Love without expectations, without anything in return, does return so much more than people with expectations can ever imagine. </p><p>Leaving you here with a movie that reflects a similar journey. It is a good watch and completes what I am saying here. </p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FE0ZLvfITSc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nanhe Jaisalmer - Youtube link</a><br><br></p><p class="msg msg--highlight">Note: I didn't add details about her, no specific timelines, no specific places. I know a few people with a lot of time interested in figuring this out. I can't leave clues here. But if we had the above conversation, you would know it was you. You had a big impact, without realizing it. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on July 22, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fthe-crush.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fthe-crush.html&amp;via=thebstar13&amp;text=The%20Crush" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fthe-crush.html" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=The%20Crush https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fthe-crush.html" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><img src="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/media/website/WhatsApp-Image-2025-01-20-at-9.28.12-AM.jpeg" loading="lazy" height="1600" width="768" class="bio__avatar" alt="Bikram Sutar"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/authors/bikram-sutar/" rel="author">Bikram Sutar</a></h3><div class="bio__desc"><p>Hey, I am Bikram.
