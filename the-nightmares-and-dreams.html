I was in school. Probably in 5th grade. I used to dream of scary demons chasing me. I used to try to run, but couldn't take a step; my legs used to feel like stone. And most of those nightmares used to end up with me wetting my bed. </p><p>While awake, I was never scared. I wasn't scared of demons or ghosts, nothing. It was just those dreams. And a wet bed. Sometimes I used to get away, sometimes I used to get caught. I was always street smart enough to get away. But on the days I used to get caught, I was always too embarrassed to say - I saw a demon, and that thing chased me. And there were 2nd kinds of dreams too, that used to feel like reality. Me going out to pee in the dream while I was still in bed. And something hot and cold used to break the illusion. </p><p>My lower primary school had classes till the 4th grade, 5th grade was a new school. School was barely 200 meters from home. I used to consider that I had graduated from one school, I couldn't be peeing on my bed. I had to find a solution. I said I was street smart, I am still, but I am just lazy. <a href="https://x.com/thebstar13/status/1478056991503175681" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">I am more lazy this year. Not having a plan has spoiled me; at the same time, I know it is a take-it-easy year</a>. I have become a bit more take it easy than I would have liked, but I am not judging this year.</p><p>Back to fixing the thing. Do you remember, I mentioned there were two kinds of dreams leading to a wet bed? Well, the one where it used to look real, and I used to feel like peeing outside, those were the ones that eventually helped me figure out the fix. I used to wake up in the middle of these dreams, with the hot pee touching the bed and parts of my body. I started being conscious, if I am peing, how fast can I realise? This helped. This led me to fix the problem and something even more beautiful. I started experiencing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_dream" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Lucid dreams</a>. These are dreams, but the dreamer knows it is a dream, and they build the story for the dream. I started knowing I was in a dream. When nightmares came, when a demon attacked, when I couldn't run, I started flying.</p><p>Sleep was so fun. It was like an immersive 360-degree experience, where I had complete control over myself and anything that I liked. Mostly, I used lucid dreams to summon and fight demons, and go on adventures. And fly, who doesn't like flying? </p><p>Why am I writing this? I recently saw a YouTube video on Lucid dreaming and techniques. That's the first time I've heard the term. They are discussing the technique, I kid's version had self-discovered this on their own. For a lot of our problems, answers are within; we just need to look closely. Not saying every problem has a solution, and every solution is within, or every solution within is the best, I am not saying that. But if you look deep enough, look deep without problems ideally, you will find so many answers. </p><p>Big question, have I still got it? Yes, I can tell if I am in a dream, in any bad dream. But going into a dream of my own story, there are more struggles these days. I didn't have a lot of REM sleep in the last few years. Most of my dreams are during naps instead. I am more of a daydreamer these days 😂. Those nightmares and Lucid dreams have shaped my reality and imagination for life. I could fight any demons, with unlimited superpower at my wish. Flying is still the best. </p><p> </p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on August 1, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fthe-nightmares-and-dreams.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fthe-nightmares-and-dreams.html&amp;via=thebstar13&amp;text=The%20Nightmares%20%26%20Dreams" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fthe-nightmares-and-dreams.html" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=The%20Nightmares%20%26%20Dreams https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fthe-nightmares-and-dreams.html" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/authors/bikram/" rel="author">Bikram Sutar</a></h3><div class="bio__desc"><p>Hey, I am Bikram and this is my blog. </p></div></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/2020-review.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> 2020: The Journey</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/life-is-good.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Life is Good</div><figure class="content__nav-image"><img src="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/media/posts/3/responsive/IMG_0041-xs.jpeg" class="lazyload" loading="lazy" alt="Life is good" height="1024" width="1024"></figure></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>❤️ @thebstar</p></div><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://x.com/thebstar13" aria-label="X"><svg><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thebstar/" aria-label="LinkedIn"><svg><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg></a></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
