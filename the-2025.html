Please put a review of the year shamelessly if you are going to plan the next year. And if you want the plan to work. It is an accountability mechanism. When you have a decent checklist ticked, it is a way to celebrate. 🎉</p><p>I wanted 2025 to be themed around health, leverage, and knowledge. Social activity was a bonus. <a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/what-can-i-get-done-52-week-sprints-2025.html">You can read this for a week-by-week progress</a>. Here I am gonna share reflections per theme and share major highlights.</p><h2><strong>Reflections</strong></h2><ul><li>Health - 8 out of 10<ul><li>Wanted to run 22 min 5k, 52 min 10k.<ul><li>Did a 22:30 5k, 52min 10k.</li><li>Got injured later. So couldn't tick 22 min 5k</li><li>7/10</li></ul></li><li>Wanted to have abs 😅<ul><li>I have a 4 pack 🎉. </li><li>8/10</li></ul></li><li>Bonus<ul><li>Got injured and recovered so fast. </li><li>Recovery is the best sign of fitness. 💪</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Leverage - 3 out of 10<br><ul><li>I wanted to start having a passive income. Didn't happen. 0<ul><li>But I actually initiated a few ideas. Did some actual effort here. Maybe I have done the groundwork.</li><li>I am very process-oriented, and sometimes I don't count results, but here I am rating myself for results, hence 0.  </li></ul></li><li>I wanted to have low liquidity, around 20%. I have 30%. So a 0</li><li>I wanted to do a lot of writeups and builds<ul><li>I did a decent no of writeups, mostly personal - 4/10 </li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Knowledge - 7 out of 10<ul><li>Did a good no of builds 6 / 10<ul><li>Won a hackathon at work. </li><li>I am constantly in the top 20, sometimes top 10 or 5 in terms of AI usage in a 300-person org. I will take this.</li></ul></li><li>Learnt Sanskrit - 5 / 10<ul><li>I can read, I can understand the subject, object. Need to learn more tenses and words. And practice. </li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Bonus - 8 out of 10<ul><li>I wanted to score a 50 in a match, ticked this. </li><li>I had decided to move away from social positions; I have done this.</li><li>I wanted to have an impact at the individual level, 5 people, I have done 4. </li><li>I would have liked to spend a little more from my social budget. I haven't even touched 1%. This is a negative. I was conscious about this in December and put in my efforts in giving. </li></ul></li></ul><h2>Highlights</h2><p>The following are the major highlights that I remember. Some of them are things I wanted to do, some of them happened and resulted in some good impact - </p><p><strong>Work</strong></p><p>I was part of a winning team at a hackathon at work. This makes it the second successive year of winning at least one hackathon. </p><p>I wanted to switch my team and move on to more horizontal impact work. I switched to data viz that is going to be used by all products inside LaunchDarkly. </p><p><strong>The SF trip brought clarity</strong></p><p>I was in SF at the start of the year and saw 500 people in a room. Saw how big organisations organize these events. Saw how a trained CEO or any senior leader brings in clarity. 1. They show you a clear vision, and 2. They have very clear steps to the vision. 3. If each step is trackable, it is going to be more effective. I have been practicing it. This was my takeaway from the trip. Yeah, the city was beautiful. And probably one of the cities I won't mind living in for a long time.</p><p><strong>A dull month</strong></p><p>It is rare for me to have a dull month. But I had a few. I was probably around March when I started talking to someone. And I surrendered to the idea of getting married. I surrendered and said Whatever it is, I am gonna make it work. She was very pretty, maybe the prettiest, and very innocent. Maybe the most innocent girl I have met to date, in this case. But something wasn't clicking. I was dragging it.</p><p>In July (IG July), I was in Kolkata. I was reflecting on whether I should continue. I visited a few places - the Botanical Garden, the Indian Museum. I got a message from a friend (now a friend). Sometimes people can do so much to you without them knowing. She did that to me. I received her message. Replied to her. Wrote a message to the girl above. We had a call later, and I let her know how/why I felt it wasn't going to work. Because of this friend (SA), I was able to drop the baggage, I felt lighter, back on my feet. I owe her a big thank you and a big gratitude message.</p><p>I might have walked away from above at some point, as I know myself. Or maybe not because I had surrendered. I don't know. But SA made it happen real quick for me. Never a dull moment in life. This brought me a different kind of clarity. I have been caring for it; it contributed to my life outside as well. A big indication is that my cricket, running, and fitness have improved a lot. Maybe my work too, but I take work religiously, hence it would go well irrespective of outside life. </p><p><strong>Hit a peak</strong></p><p>I thought people would slow down in their 30s. And I had in some sense started to slow down. But around Dussera, I hit a peak. I am in a flow state after that. I have a lot of energy. Mentally physically. Above is one contributor, maybe. And 2nd was that I found more impactful work. I feel like I am in my early 20s. Even when I get injured, I recover so fast. ⚡ Since I have tasted this, I am not gonna go back. </p><p><strong>More than words, intention matters</strong></p><p>I am reading Gandhiji's autobiography. He mentions how words can be misused, misdirected to convey different meanings. But when you promise, when you make a pact to be true, you should be true to the intention. This has hit me. I am going to be true to my intentions more to others. To myself, I am gonna make sure that while setting goals, I don't leave room for different meanings. </p><p><strong>Chaos to settle</strong></p><p>Expectedly, I am ending the year with more chaos and more uncertainty. I have the next few weeks before I lock in 2026. Chaos should settle, and the execution should take over. It is okay to have chaos if execution continues to be excellent. </p><p><strong>Fun</strong></p><p>2025 was fun. Khushi (sister in law) got transferred. I have a sister at home. Everyone is happy. A lot of friends got married. Danced a lot 😅. Now they say it is on us!  </p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/hmgt6FLy9aI?si=DHDxrg2SHoiHusHR">Made some videos</a>. </p><p>26th is my birthday, and I have gotten a jersey that says 26 😅. So it is gonna be a fun year next. Have fun 🎉</p><p> </p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on December 30, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fthe-2025.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fthe-2025.html&amp;via=thebstar13&amp;text=The%202025%20wrap%20%E2%9C%8D" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fthe-2025.html" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=The%202025%20wrap%20%E2%9C%8D https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fthe-2025.html" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/authors/bikram/" rel="author">Bikram Sutar</a></h3><div class="bio__desc"><p>Hey, I am Bikram.
