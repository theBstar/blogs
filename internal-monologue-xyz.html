If I share this with reference, maybe then it would make sense. For now, I am trying to make a decision. </p><p>Should I do X for Y? Should I do when Y should be doing? Why should I do?</p><p>Because I can, and I know Y should. But does Y want it? Does Y want it bad? I know you want it; I am sure if you want it badly. However, I am certain that X might be the best for Y. </p><p>How certain am I? There is nothing that can go wrong doing X. Is it? Well, most variables are under control. Give me numbers, I love numbers. We can't be accurate, but everything controllable can be controlled here. Let's say 80%. I would have said 90%, I am giving out 10% room for errors. More buffer. So, I am 80% certain Y will have a great time doing X. Concluded from the fact that Y has an 80% chance of making it. </p><p>Is 80% good enough to do something? If it were me, surely it is greater than 50%. So, in a very basic game of choice, it is a good choice. But there are more factors - Y is already doing Z, and Y only has n% of percentage will to do X. </p><p>Let's redo the math. In a basic choosing game, while choosing between two things or n things, you choose the one you want the most. One that makes the most sense to you. Each n has various factors. Here I am calculating - How much Y wants both choices. And I also have an option to play a part, influence this choice, why, and when I should intervene. </p><p>If I assume Z is constant, which is, in this case, because Y knows Z and I know Z and we agree on it being a constant. As in any case, Y loses the benefit of having Z. The Same benefit will always be there. Important variables are how much Y wants it. Yw, Delta of X, Xd. </p><p>So it's more of a question, how much better X is for Y, compared to Z. It is always better, number-wise, it is -</p><p>Xd <em>Yw = .8 </em> * (Yw)</p><p>If Y doesn't want it, then it is 0, if Y wants it 100%, then it is for sure 800% better. It is an 8x jump. No brainer to do it. </p><p>I should do this. And the question I shall ask here to Y is - Do you absolutely not want it?</p><p> <a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/8020-time-to-negotiate.html">Combine this with a framework to make decisions for yourself</a> (pseudo math). </p><p> </p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on August 9, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Finternal-monologue-xyz.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Finternal-monologue-xyz.html&amp;via=thebstar13&amp;text=Shall%20I%20do%20X%20for%20Y%3F" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Finternal-monologue-xyz.html" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Shall%20I%20do%20X%20for%20Y%3F https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Finternal-monologue-xyz.html" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/authors/bikram/" rel="author">Bikram Sutar</a></h3><div class="bio__desc"><p>Hey, I am Bikram and this is my blog. </p></div></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/reflections-2025.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Reflections, mid 2025</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>❤️ @thebstar</p></div><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://x.com/thebstar13" aria-label="X"><svg><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thebstar/" aria-label="LinkedIn"><svg><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg></a></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
