                    <p><img src="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/media/posts/9/Screenshot-2024-09-26-at-1.13.58-AM.png" class="type:primaryImage" alt="Shaktiman flying" /></p>
                <p>I wanted to be a superman. Not exactly, I never had a TV growing up. My neighbourhood of 150 homes had only 2/3 TVs. I must have been 7/8 years old. My paternal uncle (edlest of my father's sibling), used to take me to one of those neighbours. It was so fun job to be flying around, to be able to help needy.</p>
<p>My mother once told me, and also Sree Krishna in Mahabharat (can't recall correctly) 'Wish for others, and good things will happen'.¬† This made so sense to my tinny brain. I had only three wishes</p>
<p>1. Give peace to everyone.</p>
<p>2. Give them good thoughts.</p>
<p>3. <em><strong>And make me Shaktiman.¬†</strong></em></p>
<p>It continued till 2008+-1 years. I used to believe I had a deep connection with god. In 2008, I got hooked into watching cricket. And I found a new idol. Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar. So simple of a man, giving so many hopes, bringing joy. I used to find myself in him. My 2 wishes remained the same. 3rd was changed now. I provided god the option. <em><strong>Make me a Shaktiman or a Cricketer.¬†</strong></em></p>
<p>It was 2011, I wrote my 10th exams. I had a proper break. I used to sit and meditate for almost half an hour every evening. Also, during this time mahabharat was being re-aired. The narator `Samay (Time)`, told how it is the only constant, only flowing truth in the form of change. It also narrated `How satya, and dharma are different, and Krishna went on to explain in Geeta, that karma is dharma`. Samay even touched how dharma isn't required when satya is there. All of this played part in shaping me - I kind of stopped praying. I completely stopped worshiping. Altough I continued wishing two pointers in the first wish to come true. I still do. But, it has changed to what I can do than what would god do. Today, I don't even believe in god in the form they are described in religions.¬†</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2014, I just wanted to get a good govt job to make my family financially stable. I was still playing cricket and had a dream of making it big one day. But reality was more closer. I had to get a job. I hadn't tought it through to be honest. My brother always wanted to join Army. He joined them in 2015. This was a financial releif. He was just 17, his actual age. I was 18 and half. We decided if He is going through it, I have to make it big now.¬†</p>
<p>At this point, I knew I wasn't going to make it big in cricket. I kind of started to hate it in reality. As I saw age frauding happening at big scale from u15 days, back in 2012. Never had that real fire for it afterwards. Now since I could aford to take sometime and We decided to do somthing big, I had to find what is it. <em><strong>I figured doing Civil services would be perfect</strong></em>. I could make a lot of impact, plus make good money. But before this thought could have been matured, I joined a computer class - Nielit O level. Loved it completely, excelled at it. And suddenly the startup door was opened.¬†</p>
<p>I had been great with people always. Had been in between them, motivating them, guiding them. I find a different energy. Plus I bring the average up. I had been doing odd businesses and handling finances for a long lnog time -</p>
<p>1. I had started a sim card selling business</p>
<p>2. I was also doing a soap selling business</p>
<p>3. I also did Chappals and Shoe selling business during my college days to support myself and the family.¬†</p>
<p>4. During the same time, I also tried selling utensils and notebooks.¬†</p>
<p>5. I was always good with money. In school days, I used to save my pocket money and lend to my father in tough times.¬†</p>
<p>I was kind of a book worm in school days, and I had read about a lot of famous personalities, making it big from 0. Again back in 2016, I was reading about startup folks - Bezos, Zuckerberg, Musk. Kind of impact they had. I didn't have a laptop, nor a cs graduation. But I was doing well in my computer class course work. I was already reversing arrays, checking prime numbers, building job application platform. üòÖ. Felt like I was built for it. Felt like I found my calling. <em><strong>I wanted to build a software company - to create something world will use, to create wealth, to have influence, to have a huge impact.¬†</strong></em></p>
<p>It was 2020, I was doing good at being a builder, being a software engineer. Earning decent money, giving back to society in own capacity, I realised what I always wanted to do - <em><strong>I wanted to have an impact in the world, to make it better, in whatever way I could, even say .00000001 percent</strong></em>.¬†</p>
<p>I am writting this in 2024. And as I look back my wishes or dreams or goals you would say, have changed over times. Yet, I have stayed relatively happy and successful (peace) during each of those phase. At times, I wasn't doing what I love. <em><strong>But I aboslutely loved what I did</strong></em>. Wise words guiding to - focus on the proccess and not results helped tremendously.</p>
<p>Is this the complete truth? As I delved deeper, I found that I always wanted to do one thing, I always loved one thing - which is <em><strong>making an impact.¬†</strong></em>How I expressed it changed over time, how I wanted to make this happen did chagne. But i look at the wishes, goals, core of it has been¬† driven by <em><strong>a fire to make an impact</strong></em>. Things are connecting now.¬†</p>
<p>I have a mountain to move before I sleep, and there is only a little time.¬†</p>
<p>See you!</p>

                <p>In the 2nd week of September 2024, I flew to Mumbai for my b1/b2 US visa interview. Good news is I got the visa. On this note, I am sharing how I overprepared for the interview. And how, I often at times, overprepare.¬†</p>
<p>The interviews were on 9th and 10th. I got good advices from Co-founders@Houseware and senior colleagues. And the visa agent too. My conclusion was to get as many documents supporting my case as possible. On 10th, the consular interview day, I had a big stack of dcouments with more than 35 pages. I was a bit early to the interview place. So, I had to wait outside, Entires were time sloted. So, I waited for my turn.</p>
<p>I went in, waited on another queue, and finally met the interviewer. He asked a few basic questions, like - Where are you going? Why are you going? What do you do? Who is paying for the trip? And said `Your visa is approved`. Didn't look at any documents.¬†</p>
<p>While heading back to hotel, I started thinking, the entire stack of documents, there weren't required. No one checked them. I felt like I overprepared for it. No, I hadn't done any interview preparations, as this was more of a factual interview, not a skill or presentation. But, I had done preparation to get these documents, get them printed. All for nothing?<br><br>One part of my brain started:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>¬†Hey, you prepared for the worst, and your job is a success. Why does it matter if you overprepared. What if they had actually asked for some of those documents. By preparing for the worst you were ready to face the worst. You could pull out ¬†any document they could have asked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the other half said</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, this is legit. And I am not disappointed, and since you, have nudged myself to the final outcome, I am really happy that I got the job done. But, these kind of overpreparation has led me to missing out on opportunities earlier. Always going for perfection, preparing for the worst always, have let me down. Once, I was preparing for my Google Certified Web depeoper exams. Had a long planned preparation cycle. But, they stopped giving certifications before I felt ready.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First half again</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh, I see you. Going for perfection, preparing for the worst shouldn't happen at the cost of never feeling ready. Prepare for the worst, go for the perfection but within your limited resources - 'time' especially. This often works like magic when you have to run faster but at the same time have space to re-try. 80-85% success, 15% failure is a sweet spot, tight your resources by opening your mind to 85% readiness. Plan like this. Then push extra for the 100%.¬†</p>
</blockquote>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>Makes sense now. Overpreparation is just preparation, when done with an obsession for the goal.¬†</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>Let's hit more goals üéØ</p>

                <p>Okay, it was live always, but wasn't updated. My website and blogs were in one place. To write a blog I had to open my terminal and a code editor. This was a huge friction. And slowly as I mentioned earlier, Whatsapp notes took over. I started taking notes on Apple notes, Whatsapp self-DM, and on my iPad.</p>
<p>Updating the website and blog was always in my mind. So much that, I started building a blog engine. Visual blog builder. It worked. It can create basic page with a visual rich text editor. <a href="https://github.com/theBstar/blogder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Still a prototype - find it on github here</a>. As I started using it, I found it needs a lot of features. Initially plan was to just build the features. But I have limited time. And I wanted to build a blog engine to just start blogging again. I wanted to build it, such that I didn't have to open my terminal and IDE to dump something. Fortunately, <a href="https://getpublii.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">I found Publii, a public open-source static CMS</a>. It does exactly this. I can write without touching terminal, IDE, without thinking deployment, and it connects to github pages. YaY ü•≥ !</p>
<p>I am back at writing online. It is fun again. Now, I had to update the homepage. <a href="https://v0.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">V0.dev</a> has been one of the best things on frontend in recent times. I coded up the initial page with just a few touches. And <a href="https://www.thebstar.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the updated website is also live - same old url thebstar.com.</a> üöÄ</p>
<p>I have picked up a really good pace in the last 2 weeks. This blog is just the tip of it. Just a sneak peek into my builder energy picking up. Will be sharing more soon!</p>
<p>Cool, lets do some small talk. I went shirt-less twice in a crowd last week. I was attending a funeral of a friend's dad. Last rituals were on the bank of a river. We took a bath afterwards. Later in the week, I went to singri to do nets practice on Saturday (21st September 2024). Went shirt-less again due to heat and sweat. I have some fotage from the session, and I look good. I hadn't seen some of those muscles (I still have to look hard though üòÖ). Motivation to hit the gym. üí™ I have missed the gym for last 3 weeks completely. Had to do some travel. Will tell the story later. This is already long and it is almost 1am now.¬†</p>
<p>Take care!</p>

                <p>Past is gone. Future is yet to come. Present is what you live. It is easy to carry burden of past and bias our decisions - Morgan Housel, The Psychology of Money. Similarly it is easier to look too much into future and ruin our present.¬†</p>
<p>Present, now is the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">most valuable</span> resource to get to future. It is the only resource. It is the only oil. Important to realise, every moment you spend thinking, or doing something is burning this most important fuel. Is future that important to be considered now? Do I need to go that deeper into future? Is it worth my present?</p>
<p>But life isn't this linear, nor everything has equal weight. Some things even in distant future have greater importance in life. Some experiences from past carry bigger lessons than others. So, we have to aware of the weights. And if it comes down to optimising for past, present or future. It should be always between present and future. <strong>And importance in future should have higher relative weights as closer they are in the timeline</strong>. This is importnat because, time is moving in one direction, so is life, and the best part of the life. But don't forget to enjoy the current moment. I will expand on it. Let it be meta for now. Let the entirety of this be meta for now.</p>
<p>I was coming back from Mumbai. Bus journey took 8 hours instead of usual 5. I had planned take an hour long nap in the afternoon. But I reached at 4pm. I had a play rehearsal scheduled at 6pm. I had almost slotted a nap after reaching home. So, I was feeling sleepy. But I couldn't sleep for and hour, wake up do the preparation and go to the play rehearsal. This wasn't possible. So, I decided to put some work. And later wrote this down. Went to rehearsal at 6.¬†</p>
<p>I am coming back to this and publishing it. With the updated title. Yes, Present is real. I should be optimising it, without blocking myself on past excuses, experiences. And I start to embrace more chaos in life, being able to open myself to frequent changes in plan, schedule, optimising for present is the best thing I can do for better use of the fuel.¬†</p>

<p>Life has been good to me. Things had started to fall into right places. Mentally, Physically, Financially. Whenever I didn't feel like it, I tried and tried to put them in the right places. I tried to make the life good. And now, since it has been good, averaging really good for sometime, I feel this is the right time to unleash the bull run. Take the average higher. This is important to do when I am in control. We never know when life flips it and starts a bear run.¬†</p>
<p>I am brining this blog back from ashes for the bull run, for the higher average. It is not only an opportunity but a responsibility now to make this run. This blog will act as the brain dump yard, accountability partner no one asked.</p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>Cheers.¬†</p>
