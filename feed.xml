                <p>Elon acquired Twitter, renamed it to x.com, and laid off a significant workforce, yet it continues to thrive, even more efficiently. This one question from him doing rounds on x.com - 'What did you get done this week?'. By asking this every week, I can infuse the urgency. The answer to this should be directional. There should be a goal I am working towards every week. This is a living document of 52 sprints. Read the `theme for the year` from the table of contents. </p>

<h2>April 10th, week 15th</h2>
<p>Have been holding up well in terms of fitness. Waking up early, sleeping probably less than ideal. But excercising well. Knees starting to feel little better. </p>
<p>Haven't read anything this week so far. Haven't published anything so far. BAU in work life. </p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1inmm5m8i4t">March 31st, Week 14th</h2>
<p>I have a few (two or three) sit-downs in front of computer tasks, each lasting 15-30 minutes, but I have procrastinated. This is the week I shall get them done. </p>
<p>Update on last week, Did one good run. A couple of stretches. Okay, I won't count them as quality/intent wasn't there. Did some reading - Thinking in Bets and Consumption. Got good sleep.</p>
<p>Cricket season has winded up. I also felt like taking a rest last week. Still got pulled into 2 matches. Wasted my time wildly last week. I binge-watched Marvel Punisher. Woke up way out of schedule on Saturday &amp; Sunday. Full awake midnights give me energy. This week I plan to use them in a more like 'me'. 🤘</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #169179;">Get good 3 runs &amp; 7 days of full body stretch. </span></li>
<li><span style="color: #ba372a;">MCP, set up</span> &amp; <span style="color: #169179;">play with them</span>. <span style="color: #ba372a;">Post something by the end of the week.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #169179;">Read. I have a new book on leading engineering teams that I haven't opened.</span> I have exactly two Assamese books I bought from a book fair 2 months back, I haven't opened them yet. Not sure if I will end up opening the Assamese book. Will take a hell lot of energy from me to do that. One isn't fiction so maybe I will open it. </li>
<li><span style="color: #ba372a;">By the weekend - close all housekeeping digital work pending on me. </span></li>
</ol>
<p>Update here by the end of the week. </p>
<p>Update: Week went well in terms of all 3 but the 4th item. I don't know if I will ever open those Assamese books.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1in9scsd8ei">March 26th, Week 13th</h2>
<p>Honestly, I don't remember which week this is (the 13th, I googled it). I haven't been able to tick anything from the above list. Although</p>
<ul>
<li>Health
<ul>
<li>I have been sleeping well. A good number of hours. ~8. I want to bring it down to 6/7. </li>
<li>I have also started doing a few runs. Not regular yet.</li>
<li>Physically, look-wise, I am not way far from abs. I have maintained where I got by the end of 2024. </li>
<li><span style="color: #f1c40f;">My diet can be better.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #e03e2d;">I have developed lower back pain &amp; knee pain. Have been working on recovery. Getting better. It should go away in the next 2 weeks. </span></li>
<li><span style="color: #e03e2d;">Should hit the gym. </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Learnings &amp; Build
<ul>
<li>I have been reading books - Recently reading Thinking in Bets.</li>
<li>I have built a few new POCs, on the build side, all on my Git Hub - https://github.com/thebstar. </li>
<li><span style="color: #e67e23;">Still running behind on the latest AI stuff, practically. </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Growth &amp; Investment
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #169179;">I have started technical advising in a tech startup. <a href="https://spacesos.com/" style="color: #169179;">https://spacesos.com/</a></span></li>
<li>I have set up some passive investments. Long term investments</li>
<li>I have been looking to set up at least one manufacturing plant that in theory will give me a good return. </li>
<li><span style="color: #e03e2d;">I haven't yet worked on how many people I reached, branding. My next update should have something on it.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hobby &amp; fun
<ul>
<li>I have played a lot of cricket matches. It will slow down now since season is mostly over.</li>
<li><span style="color: #e03e2d;">I haven't progressed much in new language learning. Maybe I shall go and practice with someone. </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1in9scsd8ej">Week 4 (Week of 20th Jan)</h2>
<ol>
<li>Health - Resume Gym (have been off from mid-2024)</li>
<li>Leverage -
<ul>
<li>Money - I have 1L to play around and generate a return from the market/crypto/physical investment. Set up a plan/schedule this week. So that I can start thinking/executing from next week. Can I grow it X% in 3 months (X to be filled)?</li>
</ul>

</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1in9scsd8ek">Week 1 to 3</h2>
<p>I didn't get anything done in these 3 weeks that aligned with the direction I had set. I am here finalizing the direction on the <strong>4th week, 20th of Jan</strong>. Hence, Can I say I created the clarity? Saying this, I did start re-reading the 11th Math book. Read Set theory, functions, and Relations.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1in9scsd8el"><strong>Theme for the Year</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>Leverage - Wealth, brand. Questions to answer - <br>

<li>How many people did I reach?</li>
<li>How many valuable connections did I make?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Health - Let's have the visible abs this year. If not this year, it isn't happening anytime. Questions to answer
<ul>
<li>What did I do this week to have visible abs?</li>
<li>Did I sleep well? Overslept, under-slept?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Knowledge - Be on top of AI and establish engineering excellence in the network. Math is back. 
<ul>
<li>What did I learn?</li>
<li>What did I build &amp; publish on the web? Engineering Article, new product, open source contribution?</li>
<li>What did I read?</li>
<li>What did I learn in math?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, I will pursue items from the following list, but all of them are secondary, and I shouldn't be judged on them.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have a wishlist that includes playing plenty of cricket matches.</li>
<li>Learning a language (my goal for 2024). </li>
<li>Continue my social &amp; community work
<ul>
<li>I am mostly putting a full stop on running the cricket club. </li>
<li>And I am putting a full stop to active social work on commitment. I won't hold any positions. </li>
<li>I will evaluate mid-year if I want to continue the kids' enablement sessions</li>
<li>What's the most impactful thing I can do for the community? </li>

                <p>It was 2011. Mom used to do her evening Puja, and I used to sit on a chair outside, soaking it, kind of passive-meditating, those sessions used to last 20 to 45 minutes. Most of that time was spent thinking, daydreaming, and chanting. I was an introvert; I always had a vivid imagination and could create a scene and play in my head during the sessions. During these times, the things pondered were - <em><strong>How can someone work every day? Without play? How hard must it be to be an adult?</strong></em></p>
<p>I still can't understand how people work without play or fun. They must have fun in their own way. But after working full-time for the last six years, I have started working every day. I didn't touch my laptop from the 21st to the 30th of December, and this is the longest streak without work in my career. I will be out of the office until the 6th of January 2025. This is a good reset before the new year, but I am not used to it. And I couldn't stop myself from pulling out my laptop today. </p>
<p>Year-end is a good time to reflect and plan for the coming year. Some people argue it is just another cycle of the sun, yes, it is. But every new round is an opportunity to let go of burdens &amp; start afresh. <em><strong>Every new cycle is the beginning of New Hope</strong></em>. May it be entirely new, or may it be compounding. I have been talking about my life working in cycles. And funnily, a very hard-working, thoughtful, and relatively successful friend mentioned another angle of looking at the cycles. Three years is the optimal time I have found to be working on one cycle, for me. This is a number that makes more sense looking back. </p>
<p>The end of each cycle is a new beginning. I am wrapping up the last cycle and sitting on the horizon for the next to begin. My birthday falls in Feb, but I keep a count of December, It is a great time for a new start. Gives me a head start of 2 months. 2024 has been a kind year. <strong>For the few of you who know, </strong>2016 to 2019 was finding my feet, 2019 to 2021 was redemption. 2022 was a break year. I wanted to step back and break out of habits and schedules - although all were good habits. I put on 14 extra kgs. I Lost them in 2023 in the first 2 months. 2023 and 2024 were supposed to be the prep year. And so they were. So,<strong> where am I now? Where do I want to head?</strong></p>
<p>Let me answer my approach to living first. This would flow into where I am. And where I want to head. In one of the interviews - either Gayle or Darren Sammy said - We west Indians live like there is no tomorrow. It was surely a decade ago. It was in my mind, but it got into my way of living only a few years ago. I lost one uncle in the village, who was very supportive of us in our hard times. I was sad for a bit. I am very realistic about life. I tried to understand the emotion, and it turned out - I was sad because I wanted to say how grateful I was to him and how much he meant to me. Life gave me a chance when He was alive; I didn't take it. I never thought I had limited time, yet we all have limited time. <strong>Rule no 1: Think there is no tomorrow - while treating people. Rule no 2: Death is eventual; be prepared for it, The way to be prepared is to have no regrets and have pride in myself.</strong> I stole it from a Hindi movie called - Roudi Rathor. Action-Drama, if you have a hell of free time, then Bollywood can kill time. </p>
<p>Rule 2 to live is a bit meta, let's break it down. What does it mean to have no regrets? What does it mean to have pride? Oh, you might be looking for where I stand in life. This paragraph should answer it. Back to regrets and pride. We all mess things up. And regret not taking an alternative. But can we not take an alternative after X days? Let's say - I had an ugly fight with a hostel mate, and one part of my brain says the fight wasn't required, and my ego says I stood up for myself. When my ego settles down in two days, it might be too late to settle things up. This is where I would regret not settling it earlier. But not with rule 1. I wouldn't pick up the fight in the first place, and if even 1% of my brain says that wasn't required, I would go settle it up. Even after 10 days later. <strong>Regret is a missed opportunity</strong>. And when it comes to people, you always have an undo button unless time runs out. And it does run out very fast. But how do you not have regrets for, let's say, not scoring enough in 12th? Well, I can't do anything about it now, you can theoretically solve a math problem by proving it is unsolvable. Similarly, if I can't solve a situation in life, it is the reality. I have to accept and make the changes today with all the learnings. What about pride, then? Well, <strong>pride is pretty much a feeling of excellence</strong>. An honest answer to "Did I give it my all"? I am not too fused about Did I get it all? With all the resources I had, did I do justice? <strong>"With a relatively good brain and a good mind, did I create the impact in the world in my capabilities, or did I try my best to create it"? </strong><em>This is the question for me. </em></p>
<p>I have broken down the Rule 2 in the above paragraph. As you might have noticed, both Rules 1 and 2, and almost all my conversations are around people &amp; impact. And this is what I want to do. This is what I have been trying to do. Have an impact on people's lives. Wherever I live, wherever I go, whoever I cross paths with. In return for my selfish pride and preparing for eternal truth. I can tell you I have been doing decently good at it. I have been able to touch &amp; inspire a few souls. Have tried a bunch of things in pursuit. It is a lifelong project, after all. This is where I stand. You got the answer finally. 🕺</p>
<p>It must be 3 minutes already. It is going to be a long read. And I am intentionally keeping it more abstract in the beginning. I don't want people to read actual stuff. I want them to drop off before they read the actual stuff. I am an introvert, as I said already. Even if you read, I don't want to answer anything concrete in follow-ups. I am always on for going abstract and more philosophical conversations. </p>
<p>Another filler line after a filler paragraph. I am 28, and in my mind, I am jumping into my 30s. Just 2 years in my 20s, so I should start preparing. I am betting on my good habits to be equally productive at 60. What's the point of physical, mental &amp; nutritional attention, what's the point of living remotely in a village, never touching alcohol, even no caffeine if not. This means I have optimistically 30 years of having peak impact. These are pointless numbers why am I bringing them up? I wanted to start up a few months ago. I explored a few ideas and domains. The answer to what I wanted to do - has always been to have an impact on first-degree people's lives. But startups are a wealth creation tool, not necessarily first-degree people's impact. Then why not NGOs? I wanted to start-up to create wealth. Wealth enables impact; It can enable NGOs, can't it? If 20's was the knowledge accumulation time, 30's is the wealth and leverage creation phase. My bet is to compound all of it in the '40s and have a massive impact in the 50s and '60s and compound just on impact &amp; leave it here in the latter half of life. </p>
<p>This is the horizon I am looking at, from knowledge to wealth creation/accumulation. Knowledge accumulation should be passive and continuous. We learn to stand, and then we learn to walk. Standing becomes passive even when we continue learning sprints, long jumps. That's how compounding works. The horizon I am looking at requires taking bets, thinking bets, and winning bets. It is a game of delicate thinking &amp; execution - smart work some people say. I am bad at giving references, but I want to get better in 2025. It is also a game of luck. But <strong>luck, as I define it, isn't such a miracle. </strong></p>
<p>If you are still here, I wish you a very good new year. I know we all are in a fight. Each new cycle will make you more powerful and wiser to keep fighting, and till you keep fighting, it is your game. <strong>Luck will come your way, and you will bend it to your will, as I said, Luck isn't such a miracle. </strong></p>

                <p>Welcome to week 2 👋. I should mostly start running physically and get myself closest to running mentally. This is what week 2 is all about. If I do it well, there will be Bangalore Diwali celebrations to end the week. I don't have much idea about the celebration, though. I will update this on Monday, 28th October 2024. </p>
<p><strong>Nov 3rd, Sunday 2024, PST</strong></p>
<p>I am in SF for the next two weeks for company work. Things have changed. I haven't made any progress on building the product or talking to people. I missed hitting the gym for the entire week.</p>
<p>It was a short working week. In the latter half, I went for a few cricket games. I have been reading 'The Clear Thinking,' which is very much in line with Thinking, Fast &amp; Slow. </p>
<p>It was a very messy week to summarize, or I can't summarize. Stay tuned for updates from SF. One of my friends suggested I should use more social media. Blogging isn't a great medium for uploading pictures. If I end up taking enough good pictures, I will think. </p>
<p><strong>Nov 9th, Saturday 2024, PST</strong></p>
<p>It has been a busy week. Early morning runs / walks, work, evening naps, Sightseeing IST standup, phone, laptop, sleep 🔁 repeat. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Week 3, 11th Nov to 17th 2024</strong></p>
<p>---- Wish I had filled this up, But there was barely anything new here. ----</p>
<p>Worked from room &amp; office a few days a week. Got back to proper building after some time. Played a hell lot of cricket. Played 4 matches in a weekend. I don't think I can beat that, neither I want to. </p>
<p>Thats How the November went. And first 2nd week of December too. </p>

                <p><strong>October 24th 2024</strong></p>
<p>It is 10.50 pm and I am wrapping up my day. I am not providing <a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/week-1.html">my daily update here, For that go read this</a>. Here, I am confessing, a secret confession. And if you read this, don't tell anyone because it is <strong>secret</strong>. And don't even ask me!</p>
<p>The confession: I have lost my bio-sleep clock. From 2016-2019, magically, I developed this ability to sleep an exact number of hours. Wake up without an alarm. I could sleep and wake up just on time. Every day for the next few years. It sounds weird, but It is true. For the last few months, I have been fighting hard to wake up to my alarm and yet have been missing it so many times! And it has been a quest to get my powers back. </p>
<p>It feels magical when you have the perfect start to the day. And waking up on time, without an alarm, is part of the perfect start. It gives a really big boost to my day. These small things keep me fresh and more active than any coffee machine. </p>
<p>As I reflect and write this, I can pinpoint one instance where I nearly missed my flight, and maybe that was the start of losing confidence. Subconscious operating prompts got messed up. Time to rewire. </p>
<p>Time to set off the alarm to freshen my powers. Time for those timed naps. Time for a perfect start to the day. As I have been always used. </p>
<p>Time for the perfect sleep now 😴</p>
<p><strong>October 27th 2024</strong></p>
<p>I tried removing the alarm and also tried putting a stricter instruction to my brain - that I must wake up at 5.30 am. I am almost there now. Energy is back. The Undertaker needs to raise (I will write on this later)!</p>
<p><strong>Sat Nov 9th 2024</strong></p>
<p>I am back on track. I have travelled to us, and my sense of timezone is till getting blended into my biological clock. But I don't need alarms anymore. It is a good feeling. I sleep extra on Staturday mornings, I pull all nighters once in a month on Staturday. All it took was a few concious weeks. I will provide one more update once I am back in bangalore. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>December 30 2024</p>
<p>I am at home, and I don't need alarms. This is normal. </p>

                <p>Moved to Bangalore, wasted time waiting for furniture, the cleaning guy, and some scrolling to infinity. I will call it a day for today. </p>
<p><strong>Week 1 starts tomorrow 🎬</strong></p>
<p>I will be in Bangalore at least till December end. I saw a year progression tweet - 80% is done. We have only 20% left of 2024. Time to buckle up. This is a live document for week 1. </p>
<p>Before we start, I have a few goals - </p>
<ul>
<li>Setup the place ✅</li>
<li>Hit the gym ✅</li>
<li>Cricket practice 2 days a week 🔴</li>
<li>Eat and sleep well - it is a long game. ✅</li>
<li>Build the first version of Kidli - Web send to select parents. - Instead did a soft signup launch - got the first signup. 🟡 🥳</li>
<li>Build the Kidli App (ios/android) - Do a release </li>
<li>Get 100 paid parents</li>
<li>Publish articles - Tech, Leadership, learnings - 2 articles a week. 🟡</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: I might change some in November but until then let's run with these. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Day 0 - Sunday, October 20th 2024</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Received the rejection email from <a href="https://www.zfellows.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ZFellows</a> - Without any traction &amp; a co-founder it was kind of obvious. But hey, It fast-tracked my pitch deck and solidified the space. Talked to a few potential users, which I was delaying otherwise. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Day 1 - Monday, October 21st 2024</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Setup wifi, room ✅, few things pending - take delivery of chair, a big bucket since the area seems to have some water issues, bedsheet &amp; a pillow</li>
<li>Fixed gym - hitting from tomorrow. Found a cricket club - a scheduled match on Sunday. ✅</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Should have Kidli API running today</span>. 🧑‍💻 Update: Only got basic Azure open ai llm wrapper setup. Didn't complete this. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Day 2 - Tuesday, October 22nd 2024</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Had a good day at work. Did some WebGPU experiments. ✅</li>
<li>Didn't make much progress on the personal front. </li>
<li>Okay, went to the gym. First day! ✅</li>
<li>Caught cold somehow 🥶</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Day 3 - Wednesday, October 23rd 2024</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cold got worse. Wasn't at 100%, to be honest. </li>
<li>Initially, I thought I would take a complete break, could only sleep so many hours. Later did some experiments at work.</li>
<li>Yes, Went to the gym. ✅ I picked myself up. I could have had a better day. These cold and all shouldn't stop me. Show up! to Everything, Everywhere committed!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Mid-week thoughts </strong></p>
<p>There have been a few observations and thoughts that have slowed things down. But it shouldn't really—time to re-center the focus. I need to release a v0 this week. Even if it means just an LLM wrapper. </p>
<p>Also, and it is an old realization, My day outside of work is heavily proportionate to my day at work. I should find ways to do the best work at any cost. Or start decoupling these two for the better. </p>
<p>Looking forward to the next 3 days! And a game on Sunday 🏏</p>
<p><strong>Day 4 - Thursday, October 24th 2024</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Rested from gym.  I will share my complete schedule for accountability. I shall update my calendar. And sell myself to the calendar. </li>
<li>Had a good day at work - solved a few issues, helped fix one critical issue, and ran one good experiment. I am thinking of writing one article tomorrow on at least one experiment I ran in the week. ✅</li>
<li>My Google Play console account verification was out of date. Updated - it took some time. Hope verification completes soon. 🟡 I would have liked to have at least the auth part solved today, but I couldn't do it. Let's do it tomorrow. I want to see a big check tomorrow. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Day 5 - Friday, October 25th 2024</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Not much progress on Kidli</li>
<li>Work wise a good day. Great demo by the team ✅</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Day 6 - Saturday, October 26th 2024</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Talked to an Edtech expert, with deep expertise in building learning experiences. Provided some references to people working in the space in India.</li>
<li>Also found Thecuriousparent, thanks to an old friend, Seems like the guy is fighting the exact problem. Would be interesting to talk to. Let's see if I can set up a chat.</li>
<li>Went deeper reading into b2b sales. Good all-nighter. Slept around 4, back at 8 with full energy. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Day 7 - Sunday, October 27th 2024</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Soft launched Kidli - Updated website, added Google Analytics, added waitlist form &amp; sent to parent groups, and Reddit. I must figure out if I can publicly put it on my socials. Socials reminded me, that I should add social links to the homepage. ✅</li>
<li> Got one signup. It always starts like 0, 1, ... 🥳</li>
<li>Had planned to go for a run, but missed. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Overall, it was a productive week. Got some work done, plus good food &amp; physical activity. I am writing this at 7.15 pm IST. Had a long screen time today, and I will be reading some books now. </p>
<p>It is only going to get better from here. 💪</p>

                <p>I am flying to Bangalore. I have been doing it three or four times a year. What is new? Only this time, I don't know when I am returning home. </p>
<p>I am thinking of starting up. In fact, I have been thinking of starting up for more than a decade now. My good old roommates would know that I was always interested in making an impact and building a business. I did a few business stints while I was in college. 2016 to this day, has been a build-up to making a great one. I hope so 🤞.</p>
<p>And I feel this is the time. The next step from here - having a crack at building a billion dollar Company. Every calculation I have been running leaves me with only one possible path at this junction of life. Startup!</p>
<p>I have been blessed to be in tech. If I crack a good product and have revenue streams, it is easier to build a venture-backed business in this space, and scale really fast. And what better place than Bangalore? I can't afford SF 😅.</p>
<p>I have some money in the bank to pay myself a minimum salary (monthly expenses) and some for operating costs and emergencies. I have unlimited energy. You can be on 5 coffees and 3 red-bulls, and I will still beat you in the second continuous marathon, just on water. I have convinced my parents not to rush me into marriage (typical Nepali/Gorkhali parents). I have all the time on that front as well. The point is, this is the time.  </p>
<p>I am flying to Bangalore this Sunday, October 20, 2024, to explore the next phase. I don't know where it will lead me, but I know where I want it to lead me. I don't know if I will be broke by next year, but I know I will be more than fine.  </p>
<p>I have a fascination with hardship and challenges. I am romanticizing it already. It is a Himalayan peak climb, Mount Everest. But imagine the peak being unique to the climber &amp; the climber doesn't get Sherpas.</p>
<p>I love the journey, or rather, I love myself enough to endure any journey; I love the peak. And the peak is the true love. </p>
<p>Love makes it worthwhile.</p>

                <p>My rough notes on trying to model a formula for deciding between two choices, A and B.</p>
<p>There are two options, A and B. You are very much gravitated towards A. I will give this a score of 80. 80 because it is close to certainty but not yet certain. Only things beyond 90 inches to certainty. 50/50 is when you aren't sure. 60/40 is still in the uncertainty zone, IMO. Even the 70, on the other hand, is clarity and conviction towards A. If I follow <a href="https://www.seedtoscale.com/blog/kunal-shahs-delta-4-theory-of-successful-startups" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Delta 4 framework by Kunal Shah</a>, Here the Delta is 4. It 70/30 clarity rule is even practiced by Amazon in decisions making if I recall correctly. But for critical decisions, where speed still matters, 80/20 is a one. It provides a balance of clarity and certainty. 70/30 for more speed. </p>
<p>The thought came to me while driving yesterday morning. For A/B with initial weights as x/y and it to be x'/y'. A simple formula can work. We scale B to get the new ratios. k, a multiple of B to achieve the x'/y' </p>
<p><span class="base"><span class="mord mathnormal">k </span><span class="mrel">= </span></span><span class="base"><span class="mord"><span class="mfrac"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist"><span class="mord mathnormal"><span class="mrel">(</span>x<span class="mbin">⋅</span>y<span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight">′) </span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span></span></span></span></span>/ <span class="base"><span class="mrel">(</span></span><span class="base"><span class="mord"><span class="mfrac"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist"><span class="mord mathnormal">x</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight">′</span></span></span></span><span class="mbin">⋅</span><span class="mord mathnormal">y) </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>Using this to change an 80/20 decision to 50/51, k needs to be greater than 4.08. </p>
<p>To change it to 20/80, k needs to be greater than 16. This means B needs to be 16x better choice suddenly compared to A. </p>
<p>What does this mean in the real world?<br><br></p>
<p>if you have two options, A and B. And you are 80% sure about A. You can negotiate for a B 4x better for it to win. And when you already have such a strong affinity towards A, sitting on the negotiation table doesn't harm. You come out with a 4x, or you have an A anyway. Who knows if you are even getting a 16x? It absolutely does not harm if you are comparing future optimistic value vs liquidity today.</p>
<p>Go, use the formula. To make it more robust, you can update it with an inflation factor for money, risk &amp; opportunity cost for new opportunity cost, joy vs regret weightage for emotions, state of mind, etc. </p>

                <p>It is funny how often I turn on my <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-person_view">third-person view camera</a>. Whenever I sit to do retro, reflect on emotions, or anything in life, even when I set the ideal stage for myself in the future, I look at myself from this view. </p>
<p>Recently, I started realizing this. A lot of the time the person in the center stage is me but detached. Has its own identity. I think I understand him the most. This has been helping me to learn more about myself. How I act, how I feel, how I react. And deduce my thoughts, actions, and reactions to points in time in life. Sometimes these points are ranges, sometimes they are absolute. They are most helpful when absolute. If everything were absolute, then life would have been less fun, and less diverse.</p>
<p>This is a release post for something else I have been brewing. `Brewing` reminded me I just installed `homebrew` on my new Mac. Yes, I got a Mac for myself a few days ago.</p>
<p>Dussehra is on in Assam. I will visit the pandals now. 🥳</p>

                <p>Hey, what are you saying? You don't even believe in god! - This is how they would react to the title. Yes, I don't believe in the traditional definition of God. Most of them sound very selfish and human. Can't be someone who created the universe. Then, do I believe someone created the universe? I don't know. This is a very blurry line. But I respect people's beliefs - it is important to call out early. </p>
<p>You might have gotten an idea already; This isn't a spiritual guide. By God, I mean the really good quality work, the dedication, and countless hours that go unnoticed. Honesty in the process is the path to get there. It leads you to the God. It motivates you to stay strong, keep pushing, get better, and see God. </p>

(Spiritual and religious are different; She might be in between, actually). She is fasting these nine days. Sleeping on the floor. She even developed shoulder pain in the last two days. People were suggesting she should sleep in bed today. I went on to check before locking my room. She is still beside her Durga maa pratima on the floor, in a deep sleep. She might be in a little pain tomorrow, but the peace she has today beats everything. </p>
<p>What is stopping her from sleeping on the bed?  No one is watching or judging her. It is her. She is making the call. She has made a promise, and she will keep it. It might not be all comfortable, but she will do it till she can. And these honest, pure heart - no fluff efforts are what I feel are paths to god. She can't agree more.</p>
<p>Similarly, in work or academics, these no-fluff hours separate the Best from the good. Honesty in the process and honesty with self are paths to great work. </p>

                    Everything changes. Change is the only constant. You either try hard to drive the change, try controling it or flow with the change. You have no other choice. Not every change is worth your attention. But some are. Some are worth everything. If I could&hellip;

                <p>Everything changes. Change is the only constant. You either try hard to drive the change, try controling it or flow with the change. You have no other choice.</p>
<p>Not every change is worth your attention. But some are. Some are worth everything. If I could I would put all the resources I could imagine. If it feels like this, and if it is realistic. Be optimistic about it and put everything in it. Control the change. </p>
<p>I have been controling my change. Okay, 'Fate' - here I say the magic word. Does this mean I control everything? No, I surely can only control a very insignificant of part of this big game called Life. But this insignificant small part plays a huge part in determining my fate. If fate is the infintely running car that I can't control speed of, I can certainly control steering at times. Giving me enough control to pass by certain vallies. </p>
<p>I don't like to sit static and react to change. I want to proactive. I want to guide them. I can't control the most part of it. But some vallies I want to visit, I will do everything to steer the engine it to take me there. It is time to steer it again. To new direction. To new valley. </p>
