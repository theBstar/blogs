Political parties/candidates declaring manifestos, something we have grown accustomed to. It is a worldwide practice. Often, they fail to accomplish what they state. It is ambitious. All I can say, assuming true intentions. </p><p>I had a plan for the whole year. I used to have one every year. Instead of writing a plan, I am writing a manifesto this year. I will try to make it very clear, very actionable. This should define me in the long run. 2026 is not only an election year, but it is also the year for me. 26th is my birthday. I recently got a jersey that says 26 😅. I wasn't thinking about 2026 - honestly. </p><p>For yearly goals, I want to break them down into three themes (<a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/2026-manifesto.html">Read how I baked these</a>) - </p><ol><li>Leverage - If anything, I want this badly this year. I failed at this last year. </li><li>Health - I was super on this last year. I want to double down on health. </li><li>Family, friends, and fun - I should have fun, and people with/around me. </li></ol><p>Things in 1 &amp; 3 are clearer. Let me explain the last one. We will crawl back to others afterwards. Whenever I turn into real execution, I start feeling more detached. I like being detached and not needing to depend on others. <strong>I don't want to miss out on moments of life for this. If this is gonna stop me from great things. Let this be it</strong>. And it is a huge thing for me to come here and say this. I marked the sentence bold. I want to be there for people I care about. I want to be there for moments (for things they care about). I want to check on friends. Maybe making a few new friends as well.</p><p>I want to have fun. Extreme challenges give me fun. They induce chaos in my life. Chaos that I can control and eventually feel on top. Like a fast of 30 hrs with all normal daily activities. Doing an HM without much prep, committing to have abs in a month. Deciding to learn Sanskrit.  I want to have a social impact. Last year, I moved to a more individual level focus, and I am gonna continue doing the same. </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1je7e171hbr">Time for the actual goals 🛎</h3><ol><li>Leverage<ul><li>Knowledge work (Related to what I do daily - involves my time directly) <ul><li>I want to hit a total of 2027 users on my products by the end of the year. Just users. Don't need to be paid. </li><li>Above is the ultimate goal; if that doesn't happen, I want to have proof that I did the right process, and the process is a minimum of 12 product releases. <strong>Do all of this in public</strong>. </li><li>The above will add to my knowledge. It will add to the speed of iteration and learning. It will eventually help me to find the thing I want/can jump into.  </li></ul></li><li>Traditional businesses (Indirect/passively managed)<br><ul><li>I want to have at least 1 business by the first quarter of the year. By the end of March. I shall have one person at least to manage it for me. 3 by the end of the year. </li><li>This has been a fantasy at the same time, I think there are many good untapped opportunities here. If my goal is to be near people, why not? In some way and once matured, I can use this to give back. </li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Health<ul><li>Dead straight 😅</li><li>Run 21 min 5k - Stamina, endurance, and more anaerobic </li><li>I am going to focus more on flexibility and movements this year<ul><li>Be able to hold a handstand for 27 sec</li><li>Do a bridge and return from the bridge without any support</li><li>Biggest one - do a split. I give myself 1 year. Should be enough, right? Let's see. </li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Fun<ul><li>I don't know how I quantify this yet. I need more time. (5th Jan 2026). </li></ul></li></ol><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1je7e171hbt">Updates 🔊</h3><p class="msg msg--info">⚠️ Personal space alert. Updates for each week. Raw access. Don't share, don't quote without running it by me, please 🙏</p><p>As usual, this Article will have the goals and progress updates each week.</p><p>Here we go. 🚀</p><h4 id="mcetoc_1jfjdj8sqs">Week 1</h4><p>The week was all reflections, partying, and planning. </p><h4 id="mcetoc_1jekio4rc1d">Week 2 (Week of 5th Jan) ⚡</h4><p>Jan 5th, the Plan is set for the year 🎉. I have half-built a cricket coach app. I have half-built an eye exercise website. The Eye exercise website, at this stage, is more like a lead generation place. I shall release this by the 2nd week. It is a quick win. </p><p><strong>8th Jan</strong></p><p>I had a game planned today. I had earlier planned to play this tournament. The quality of cricket was lower than what I had expected. Plus, it was today, on Thursday. I have promised myself not to play a game on weekdays unless I am done with my release for the month. Or it is a tournament match in Tezpur or Dhekiajuli, so I don't have to travel, and I can wrap up my work and cricket on the same day. </p><p>I have made a note app. I needed it to make notes on my iPad. It is close to completion as well. I am hoping to release this month. I have ordered a few electrical components to just play with things. I might order a 3d printer if I keep my energy up like this for the next 2 months. It is a good week. Let's keep rolling.</p><p><strong>10th Jan</strong></p><p>Mass used to use granola at LD. I used to use Fathom. For data &amp; privacy reasons, we are only going to use tools for which we have gotten a contract. But I like my note taker. The problem isn't the AI; it is the data going elsewhere. So, <a href="https://x.com/thebstar13/status/2010046944123728291?s=20">I built my own AI note taker today</a>. Runs completely locally with open source models. It was a pursuit to build something for me &amp; also to get my hands dirty with Claude code. Too much on X. Meh, a nothing surprising, gotta use with skill before I rate. Skill is the alpha IG.</p><p>Feels like a month, I have a lot of things, maybe all half polished, unless I use them daily, no one else is gonna use them. Have to start replacing my tools with my own. </p><p>Also did some personal reflections triggered by a conversation. Processing it, gonna sleep on it for a few days. In 2024, I realised I needed to live more in the present. Extension of the same is I need to meet people at their present, not past, not future. <a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/self-note-present-is-real.html">Nothing but preset is real</a>.  </p><h4 id="mcetoc_1jeup74f77">Week 3 (14th Jan) 🐌</h4><p>Adding a mid-week update. I got a cold in the early half. And took it easy on the 13th. Also played a few short tennis ball cricket games, put in all efforts to bowl fast. My body is still recovering one day after. I got a little slower on work as I thought I could after having a really crazy (good) last week. But I shouldn't, as I slowed at work, I slowed at my projects. But it has been a decent week, back to the crazy pace again. Oh, our team has a match in the APCC qualifier tomorrow, but I am not playing - I promise not play on weekdays (if I had done the release for the month, I would have thought). And, I had signed up for a different team in Udalguri. I didn't enjoy playing there much. I feel I shouldn't take another spot, because my first preference here was Udalguri. I saw better opportunities there initially; everything has a price. As much as I would like to preach, people know me in Tezpur, and there is a high chance they will stop me in the actual league. Let's kick hard the next two days. </p><h4 id="mcetoc_1jfjdhl3sq">Week 4 (22nd Jan)</h4><p>Back after ages. I am not very well. Got a cold. It has disrupted my schedule a bit for the last 3 days. But not everything is bad. We went to Aruncahcal last weekend. It was me, Baba di, Anita (cousin), and Tanuj. It was fun, it was a thrilling adventure as Annita mentioned. She thanked me for being brave and coming on a trip in an unknown place and hilly road with two girls and a silly boy. I have never thought like this. I have always belived man and women to be equal (apart from biological limits) and sharing the same privileges. But yeah, the world is different. I have a lot of respect for women who go out of their way, out of their comfort zone, to fight. Be it having different roles in the house or going to space, based on context and aspirations, I would always bow down to them with respect. Equality, I imagine, where women are safe and empowered to think alike and beyond, I don't know where and when it will happen. Anyway, it was a fun trip. It was cold, and I am still recovering from a cough. </p><p>I am flying to Bangalore this weekend. A few senior leaders of the company are going to be in the city. From Bangalore, I will fly to Jaisalmer and be around Rajasthan mostly for the next 20 days. Shubhankar is getting married, and I am going to attend his wedding in Udaipur on 20 and 21st. Looking forward to this as this is the longest I will be travelling. I will have to pack smart. </p><p> </p><h3 id="mcetoc_1je7e171hbs">Questions 🤔</h3><p>Laying out frequently asked questions. </p><p><strong>Biggest question - Do I get married this year? 😅</strong></p><p>I would love to be in a position to answer the person, more than the event. As soon as that happens, the event will follow. Parents want it to happen. If I manage to do well on my first theme in the first quarter, I might do this. If I don't do well there, I must leave my job to do well. I don't think that would be a good time for any new person. </p><p><strong>Do I leave my job?</strong></p><p>As I answered above, I leave my job if - </p><ol><li>I have enough clarity. I found something</li><li>If I don't iterate as much as I like to. If I don't have 3 product releases in the first quarter. </li><li>Even when I don't leave my job, it doesn't mean I do the same job - keeping the switch open. </li></ol><p><strong>Do I play cricket?</strong></p><p>I like playing cricket. I believe in the practice of great things requiring sacrifices, not animal sacrifices. I am not allowed to play cricket on weekdays (when my job is on). I am allowed to play on the off days, or if it is a T20 nearby and doesn't disturb my schedule. Or if I magically get to play abroad 😅. I am allowed to play on weekdays if my work is on track, and I have already done the release for the month. I would still have to log the days. Not exceed 12 days in 12 months. </p><p><strong>Do I shift my base?</strong></p><ul><li>If I find something and it requires me to shift for a few months - yes.</li><li>If I don't do well on my leverage targets in the first quarter. </li></ul></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on January 22, 2026</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/tags/life_updates/">life</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2F2026-manifesto-2.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2F2026-manifesto-2.html&amp;via=thebstar13&amp;text=2026%20Manifesto%20%26%20Yearbook" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2F2026-manifesto-2.html" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=2026%20Manifesto%20%26%20Yearbook https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2F2026-manifesto-2.html" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><img src="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/media/website/Screenshot-2026-01-05-at-10.44.19-PM.png" loading="lazy" height="734" width="722" class="bio__avatar" alt="Bikram Sutar"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/authors/bikram-sutar/" rel="author">Bikram Sutar</a></h3><div class="bio__desc"><p>Hey, I am Bikram.
