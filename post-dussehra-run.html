This was the week of Dussehra. I am using the past tense as it is almost over now. Dussehra in Assam was somewhat subdued this year. I had a very low, not much-moving week.</p><p>Not everything was dull. Let me catch you up with the good parts. During the last half, we organised a few games for kids. Even adults participated, and we had to let them play. For the last 3 years, we have been organising games during Dussehra. It is a new addition to the already happening 3 days of packed celebrations. Went to a few places. Eaten a lot. Visited relatives to take their blessings. Other people visited for the same reason. Walked ~6km to say goodbye to the Durga idol for the immersion.¬†</p><p>I managed to do a few runs in between. I read a few chapters from Bhagat Singh's letters, Gandhi's biography, and a book on sales. Thanks to Div for recommending the sales book.¬†</p><p>And ü•Å, I learnt to play the dhol, well, I just know 2 or 2.5 beats. But that counts, right, from not knowing anything. I can play it now. I am shameless, overconfident, and relentless when it comes to learning new things, and very curious. I had a lot of fun figuring it out on my own. No one was teaching me. My uncle said, Just keep beating it and you will figure it out. I followed the same, maybe he was actually teaching me.¬†</p><p>It sounds like a lot of fun to pack within 5 days. So, why did I start with this Dussehra being dull? Well, I missed my brother. I wanted to tease him when I was playing the dhol. I wanted him to be with me for the 6km immersion walk. I wanted him to be on my side when we visited relatives. He is the one supposed to be enjoying all this. I live moments, but I am not the one to enjoy all this. I am not to enjoy all this without him. I want others to experience, and that gives me joy.</p><p>Continuing on the above lines, one of my friends mentioned she felt alone this puja. Also, she had to take up a lot of work at home, but she felt dull and missed friends. This was day 2, and that kept reminding me of my brother. On my friend feeling alone, we used to have a lot of activities, covering time around puja, she used to be involved in almost all those events must have covered for her friends. I don't think she actually has a friend here. As I wrote the last line, I feel the gravity of the sentence. She is in her 30s already, well settled. Maybe it is time for her to get married, I keep teasing her this üòÑ</p><p>There was a famous meme circling - "cameraman focus karo", which reads - "cameraman focus on the subject". I felt sharing as I focused back on myself. I woke up early, Yay üï∫ I have gotten so better at waking up on my schedule. I woke up early and went for a run after a few stretches. I ran for 2km, and my calf and ankle were in pain. I had planned to run 8km, but stopped at 2.8km. That's just 35%. But I felt like I couldn't walk. Stopped my tracker, walked into my room, lay down, and did a long stretching session.¬†</p><p>I have been used to this running feeling. Sometimes it feels so tough. Sometimes it just flows. Well, I can reason and find triggers. It happens to be a bad day for me in running. On face value, there are good days and there are bad days. Each bad day reminds me there will be more bad days. The worst days, and there will be a stretch of those days. I shall be prepared, and you know, to have a good average, I shall double down on good days. I shouldn't let good days go at a discount. I shall turn the good days into the best days. Pretty much how and why we do savings.¬†</p><p>Earn enough and a bit more, save a bit more on good days. There will be bad days, and on bad days, try not to turn them into the worst days.</p><p>Wishing it's a good day.¬†</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on October 5, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fpost-dussehra-run.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fpost-dussehra-run.html&amp;via=thebstar13&amp;text=Post%20Dussehra%20Run" class="js-share twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> <span>Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fpost-dussehra-run.html" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Post%20Dussehra%20Run https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebstar.com%2Fblogs%2Fpost-dussehra-run.html" class="js-share whatsapp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg> <span>WhatsApp</span></a></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://www.thebstar.com/blogs/authors/bikram/" rel="author">Bikram Sutar</a></h3><div class="bio__desc"><p>Hey, I am Bikram.
